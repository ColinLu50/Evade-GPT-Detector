Thermal radiation is	Heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference. Unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection, thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum. Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object, due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature. Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared, extending into visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (i.e., the solar corona). Thus, the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth.	Heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference. Unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection, thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum. Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation that is emitted by a substance due to its temperature. The intensity and wavelength of the radiation depend on the substance's temperature and its emissivity, which is the ability of the substance to emit radiation. All objects with a temperature greater than absolute zero emit thermal radiation. The study of thermal radiation is important in various fields, including astronomy, engineering, and materials science, as it plays a crucial role in energy transfer, heat transfer, and the behavior of materials at high temperatures.
Miami is the southern terminus of Amtrak's Atlantic Coast services, running two lines, the Silver Meteor and the Silver Star, both terminating in New York City. The Miami Amtrak Station	Miami is the southern terminus of Amtrak's Atlantic Coast services, running two lines, the Silver Meteor and the Silver Star, both terminating in New York City. The Miami Amtrak Station is located in the suburb of Hialeah near the Tri-Rail/Metrorail Station on NW 79 St and NW 38 Ave. Current construction of the Miami Central Station will move all Amtrak operations from its current out-of-the-way location to a centralized location with Metrorail, MIA Mover, Tri-Rail, Miami International Airport, and the Miami Intermodal Center all within the same station closer to Downtown. The station was expected to be completed by 2012, but experienced several delays and was later expected to be completed in late 2014, again pushed back to early 2015.	Miami is the southern terminus of Amtrak's Atlantic Coast services, running two lines, the Silver Meteor and the Silver Star, both terminating in New York City. The Miami Amtrak Station is located in the heart of downtown Miami, making it a convenient transportation hub for both locals and tourists. The station features modern amenities, including a waiting area, ticketing services, baggage storage, and restrooms.

Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary, but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Mount Baker, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are technically located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.	The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary, but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, Queen Anne Hill, Beacon Hill, Magnolia Hill, West Seattle Hill, and Interlaken Hill. This topographical feature provides for stunning views of the surrounding landscape and is a defining characteristic of the city. However, the hills also pose a challenge for transportation and infrastructure, as steep inclines can be difficult to navigate for both vehicles and pedestrians. Despite this, the city has developed a robust public transportation system, including buses, light rail, and a streetcar, which serves to connect the various neighborhoods and mitigate the challenges posed by the hilly terrain.

When Nicholas II of Russia visited the Hotel Adlon in Berlin, his courtiers panicked about who would enter the elevator first, and who would press the buttons. In Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator, author Andreas Bernard documents other social impacts caused by the modern elevator, including thriller movies about stuck elevators, casual encounters and sexual tension on elevators, the reduction of personal space, and concerns about personal hygiene.	Elevators necessitated new social protocols. When Nicholas II of Russia visited the Hotel Adlon in Berlin, his courtiers panicked about who would enter the elevator first, and who would press the button. This incident highlights the social changes that came with the advent of elevators. Before elevators, people would climb stairs, and there was no need for strict protocols regarding who goes first. However, elevators brought about a new level of efficiency and speed, and people had to adjust their behavior accordingly. Elevators required people to wait their turn and follow a specific order of entry and button-pressing, which became ingrained in social norms. As a result, elevators became not just a technological advancement, but a catalyst for new social norms and practices.

At the start of the battle, a large body of Russian cavalry charged the 93rd Highlanders, who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi. Commanding them was Sir Colin Campbell. Rather than 'form square', the traditional method of repelling cavalry, Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line, two men deep. Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new Minie rifles, with which his troops were armed, at the Battle of the Alma a month before, and was confident his men could beat back the Russians. His tactics succeeded. From up on the ridge to the west, Times correspondent William Howard Russell saw the Highlanders as a 'thin red streak topped with steel', a phrase which soon became the 'Thin Red Line.'	A large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast, at Balaclava was rebuffed on 25 October 1854.:521–527 The Battle of Balaclava is remembered in the UK for the infamous Charge of the Light Brigade, in which British cavalry charged into heavily defended Russian artillery positions, resulting in heavy losses. Despite this tactical error, the battle ultimately resulted in a strategic victory for the allies, as they were able to hold onto their supply base and prevent the Russians from gaining a foothold in the area. The Battle of Balaclava is therefore significant not only for its military outcome, but also for the enduring cultural legacy of the Charge of the Light Brigade, which has been immortalized in literature and popular memory.

Bush accepted the nomination on September 2, 2004, and selected Vice President Dick Cheney as his running mate. (In New York, the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the Conservative Party of New York State.) During the convention and throughout the campaign, Bush focused on two themes: defending America against terrorism and building an ownership society. The ownership society included allowing people to invest some of their Social Security in the stock market, increasing home and stock ownership, and encouraging more people to buy their own health insurance.	On March 10, 2004, Bush officially clinched the number of delegates needed to be nominated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. Bush accepted the nomination on September 2, 2004, and delivered his acceptance speech to a packed audience at Madison Square Garden. In his speech, Bush outlined his vision for a second term in office, emphasizing his commitment to national security, economic growth, and education reform. He also took the opportunity to criticize his opponent, Senator John Kerry, for his perceived weaknesses in foreign policy and national defense. Despite facing mounting criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, Bush was ultimately re-elected in November of that year, securing a second term as President of the United States.

The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015. Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Rihanna, Beyoncé, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties. ""The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value"", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal."	On March 30, 2015, it was announced that West is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the music streaming service Tidal. The service specialises in lossless audio and high-definition music videos, and is marketed as a platform that puts the power back in the hands of the artists. Tidal aims to provide a fairer distribution of revenue to artists and also offers exclusive content and experiences to its subscribers.

In 1817 the Saxon Palace was requisitioned by Warsaw's Russian governor for military use, and the Warsaw Lyceum was reestablished in the Kazimierz Palace (today the rectorate of Warsaw University).	"In 1817 the Saxon Palace was requisitioned by Warsaw's Russian governor for military use, and the Warsaw Lyceum was reestablished in the Kazimierz Palace (today the rectorate of Warsaw University). Fryderyk and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this period, Fryderyk was sometimes invited to the Belweder Palace as playmate to the son of the ruler of Russian Poland, Grand Duke Constantine; he played the piano for the Duke and composed a march for him. Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, in his dramatic eclogue, ""Nasze Przebiegi"" (""Our Discourses"", 1818), attested to ""little Chopin's"" popularity."	In 1817 the Saxon Palace was requisitioned by Warsaw's Russian governor for military use, and the Warsaw Lyceum was reestablished in the Kazimierz Palace (today the rectorate of Warsaw University). This move marked a significant shift in the educational landscape of Warsaw, as the Lyceum had previously been housed in the Saxon Palace since its founding in 1804. Despite the change in location, the Lyceum continued to be a prestigious institution of higher learning, attracting students from across the Russian Empire and beyond. Notable alumni include the composer Frédéric Chopin and the Nobel laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz. The Kazimierz Palace remained the home of the Lyceum until it was closed by the Russian authorities in 1831, following the failed November Uprising against Russian rule.

Several projects have been proposed to extend rail service back to these areas, but lack of funding has again been the chief obstacle to implementation. These projects include the proposed Schuylkill Valley Metro to Wyomissing, PA, and extension of the Media/Elwyn line back to Wawa, PA. SEPTA's Airport Regional Rail Line Regional Rail offers direct service to the Philadelphia International Airport.	In 1981, large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to lack of funding. Several projects have been proposed to extend the service and improve transportation access for residents of these areas. One such proposal is the restoration of the Fox Chase-Newtown line, which would connect suburban communities in Bucks County to Philadelphia's Center City. This project has faced challenges, including securing funding and navigating the complex regulatory processes involved in railroad infrastructure development. Despite these obstacles, proponents argue that the benefits of improved transportation access, including increased economic growth and reduced traffic congestion, justify the investment in this project.

There are televisions with MUSE decoding built-in and set top tuners with decoders that can provide the proper MUSE input. Equipment prices were high, especially for early HDTVs which generally eclipsed US$10,000, and even in Japan the market for MUSE was tiny. Players and discs were never officially sold in North America, although several distributors imported MUSE discs along with other import titles. Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Lawrence of Arabia, A League of Their Own, Bugsy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Bram Stoker's Dracula and Chaplin were among the theatrical releases available on MUSE LDs. Several documentaries, including one about Formula One at Japan's Suzuka Circuit were also released.	In order to view MUSE encoded discs, it was necessary to have a MUSE decoder in addition to a compatible player. There are televisions with MUSE decoding built-in and set top boxes that can decode MUSE signals as well. However, the availability of compatible devices was limited due to the high cost of production and lack of consumer demand. As a result, MUSE technology was not widely adopted and was eventually replaced by digital formats such as Blu-ray and streaming services. Despite its limitations, MUSE played an important role in the development of high definition television and paved the way for future advancements in video technology.

This led to the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757, in which the Bengal Army of the East India Company, led by Robert Clive, defeated the French-supported Nawab's forces. This was the first real political foothold with territorial implications that the British acquired in India. Clive was appointed by the company as its first 'Governor of Bengal' in 1757. This was combined with British victories over the French at Madras, Wandiwash and Pondichéry that, along with wider British successes during the Seven Years' War, reduced French influence in India. The British East India Company extended its control over the whole of Bengal. After the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the company acquired the rights of administration in Bengal from de jure Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II; this marked the beginning of its formal rule, which within the next century engulfed most of India. The East India Company monopolized the trade of Bengal. They introduced a land taxation system called the Permanent Settlement which introduced a feudal-like structure in Bengal, often with zamindars set in place.	The Nawab of Bengal Siraj Ud Daulah, the de facto ruler of the Bengal province, opposed British attempts to use these permits. This led to the Battle of Plassey on June 23, 1757, which is considered to be one of the pivotal moments in the history of India. The British forces, led by Robert Clive, were able to defeat Siraj Ud Daulah's army with the help of a traitor in the Nawab's court, Mir Jafar. The battle marked the beginning of British colonial rule in India, as it allowed the East India Company to establish its dominance over the region. The battle also had far-reaching consequences for the Indian subcontinent, as it led to a gradual erosion of Indian sovereignty and the eventual colonization of the entire country.

Vowels are more-or-less similar to that of Standard Mandarin. Hokkien varieties retain many pronunciations that are no longer found in other Chinese varieties. These include the retention of the /t/ initial, which is now /tʂ/ (Pinyin 'zh') in Mandarin (e.g. 'bamboo' 竹 is tik, but zhú in Mandarin), having disappeared before the 6th century in other Chinese varieties.	Hokkien has one of the most diverse phoneme inventories among Chinese varieties, with more consonants than Standard Mandarin or Cantonese. Vowels are more-or-less similar to that of Standard Mandarin. Hokkien also has a complex tone system, with up to 8 distinct tonal categories. Due to its rich phonetic and tonal features, Hokkien is widely considered to be a challenging language to learn for non-native speakers. However, it remains an important language in Southeast Asia, especially in Taiwan and the Philippines where it is spoken by significant numbers of people. Moreover, Hokkien has also played a crucial role in the cultural and economic development of these regions, with its influence felt in areas such as cuisine, music, and trade.

If the FEV1 measured by this technique improves more than 12% following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol, this is supportive of the diagnosis. It however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma, not currently acting up. As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results. Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from COPD. It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person's asthma is controlled.	Spirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management. It is the single best test for asthma. If the FEV1 measured by this technique improves more than 12% following administration of a bronchodilator, it is highly indicative of reversible airflow obstruction, which is a hallmark of asthma. Additionally, spirometry can also be used to assess the severity of airflow limitation and monitor disease progression over time. In conjunction with other clinical assessments, spirometry results can inform treatment decisions and provide valuable information for managing asthma in patients of all ages. Therefore, spirometry should be routinely employed in the diagnosis and management of asthma.

The region grew based on the lucrative fur trade, in which numerous Native American people had important roles. Detroit's city flag reflects its French colonial heritage. (See Flag of Detroit). Descendants of the earliest French and French Canadian settlers formed a cohesive community who gradually were replaced as the dominant population after more Anglo-American settlers came to the area in the early 19th century. Living along the shores of Lakes St. Clair, and south to Monroe and downriver suburbs, the French Canadians of Detroit, also known as Muskrat French, remain a subculture in the region today.	The region grew based on the lucrative fur trade, in which numerous Native American people had important roles. Detroit's city flag reflects its French colonial heritage. (See Flag of Detroit). The fur trade was a vital aspect of the regional economy, as it brought together indigenous peoples and French traders in a network of exchange. Native Americans were often skilled hunters and trappers, providing valuable furs that were highly sought after in European markets. The French colonial influence in Detroit is evident in the city's flag, which features the fleur-de-lis, a symbol of French royalty. This heritage is a reminder of the complex history of the region, and the enduring impact of European colonization on the cultures and peoples of North America.

Zhejiang is the home of Yueju (越劇), one of the most prominent forms of Chinese opera. Yueju originated in Shengzhou and is traditionally performed by actresses only, in both male and female roles. The art form has a history of over 100 years and is known for its delicate and graceful movements, melodious singing, and elaborate costumes. Yueju has been recognized as a significant aspect of Chinese cultural heritage and has been included in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity since 2009. Despite its popularity, however, Yueju faces challenges in attracting younger audiences and in adapting to modern times. Efforts are being made to revitalize the art form by incorporating new elements and promoting it through various platforms.

"He invited a Roman Catholic priest, Father Anselm Strittmatter, O.S.B., to visit him for consultation. Von Neumann reportedly said in explanation that Pascal had a point, referring to Pascal's Wager. Father Strittmatter administered the last sacraments to him. Some of von Neumann's friends (such as Abraham Pais and Oskar Morgenstern) said they had always believed him to be ""completely agnostic."" ""Of this deathbed conversion, Morgenstern told Heims, ""He was of course completely agnostic all his life, and then he suddenly turned Catholic—it doesn't agree with anything whatsoever in his attitude, outlook and thinking when he was healthy."" Father Strittmatter recalled that von Neumann did not receive much peace or comfort from it, as he still remained terrified of death."	He invited a Roman Catholic priest, Father Anselm Strittmatter, O.S.B., to visit him for consultation. Von Neumann reportedly said in explanation that Pascal had a point, referring to Pascal's Wager. In light of this, it can be inferred that von Neumann was seeking guidance on matters of faith and the existence of a higher power. Pascal's Wager, a philosophical argument that posits belief in God as a rational choice, may have resonated with von Neumann's own beliefs or doubts. By inviting Father Strittmatter, he may have been seeking a deeper understanding of his own beliefs or a reaffirmation of his faith. This demonstrates the complexity and nuance of von Neumann's intellectual pursuits, which extended beyond the realm of mathematics and science.

The need to limit body weight in order,	Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.	Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, to maintain agility and mobility, requires that the brain be as lightweight as possible. Therefore, evolutionary pressures have favored the development of brains with high neuron density, compactness, and efficient energy utilization. These adaptations have allowed animals to achieve high levels of cognitive performance while still maintaining mobility and avoiding metabolic constraints. Consequently, brain size has become a crucial factor in determining an animal's fitness, and its evolution has played a significant role in shaping the behavior and ecology of many species.

Most speak Afrikaans or English as a first language, as opposed to Bantu languages such as Zulu or Xhosa. They also tend to have more European-sounding names than Bantu names."	"Other than by appearance, ""Coloureds"" can usually be distinguished from ""Blacks"" by language. Most speak Afrikaans or English as a first language, as opposed to Bantu languages such as Zulu or Xhosa. This linguistic difference is a result of the historical legacy of apartheid in South Africa, which enforced separate education systems and language policies for different racial groups. The Coloured community, which comprises mixed-race individuals of European, African, and Asian ancestry, was granted a separate category under apartheid and was largely educated in Afrikaans or English. Thus, language serves as a marker of both cultural identity and historical oppression for the Coloured community in South Africa."

For example, the term kitāb is often used to refer to the Quran as a written scripture, while the term dhikr emphasizes the Quran's role as a remembrance of God's message. Additionally, the term furqān highlights the Quran's function as a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong. Despite these nuanced differences in meaning, each of these terms serves to underscore the central importance of the Quran in Islamic faith and practice.

The day after he died, a letter arrived for him from the Soviet government, giving him authorization to travel to Tuva. Later Feynman's daughter Michelle would realize this journey. Out of his enthusiastic interest in reaching Tuva came the phrase ""Tuva or Bust"" (also the title of a book about his efforts to get there), which was tossed about frequently amongst his circle of friends in hope that they, one day, could see it firsthand. The documentary movie, Genghis Blues, mentions some of his attempts to communicate with Tuva and chronicles the successful journey there by his friends. Responding to Hubert Humphrey's congratulation for his Nobel Prize, Feynman admitted to a long admiration for the then vice president."	Feynman traveled to Brazil, where he gave courses at the BCPF (Brazilian Center for Physics Research) and near the end of his life schemed to visit the Russian land of Siberia, a place he had long been interested in exploring. Despite his failing health, Feynman remained determined to make the journey, driven by his curiosity and love of adventure. His passion for science and exploration inspired many young physicists, and his legacy continues to influence the field to this day. Through his travels and teachings, Feynman demonstrated the importance of curiosity, creativity, and persistence in scientific inquiry, and his contributions to our understanding of the universe remain invaluable.

The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic states that the Ming dynasty's Ü-Tsang Commanding Office governed most areas of Tibet. It also states that while the Ming abolished the policy council set up by the Mongol Yuan to manage local affairs in Tibet and the Mongol system of Imperial Tutors to govern religious affairs, the Ming adopted a policy of bestowing titles upon religious leaders who had submitted to the Ming dynasty. For example, an edict of the Hongwu Emperor in 1373 appointed the Tibetan leader Choskunskyabs as the General of the Ngari Military and Civil Wanhu Office, stating:	The official position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China is that the Ming implemented a policy of managing Tibet according to conventions and customs, recognizing the region's autonomy and respecting its cultural and religious practices. This view is disputed by many Tibetans and scholars, who argue that the Ming dynasty's control of Tibet was characterized by military conquest, forced assimilation, and the imposition of Chinese political and cultural norms. Despite these divergent interpretations, the legacy of Ming-Tibetan relations continues to shape contemporary debates over Tibet's status and the nature of Sino-Tibetan relations.

The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen. The Start button on the taskbar from previous versions of Windows has been converted into a hotspot in the lower-left corner of the screen, which displays a large tooltip displaying a thumbnail of the Start screen. Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop. Pointing the cursor in the top-left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a thumbnail list of active apps. Aside from the removal of the Start button and the replacement of the Aero Glass theme with a flatter and solid-colored design, the desktop interface on Windows 8 is similar to that of Windows 7.	A vertical toolbar known as the charms (accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen, or pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a screen) is a prominent feature of the Windows 8 and 10 operating systems. The charms provide quick access to system functions such as search, settings, and sharing, as well as app-specific functions such as play, pause, and volume controls. While the charms were initially designed to enhance the touchscreen experience, they have also proven to be useful for desktop users. However, with the release of Windows 10, Microsoft has replaced the charms with a similar feature called the Action Center, which provides notifications and quick settings access.

Beset by enemies and seeking to gain a free hand in Hungary, the Habsburgs sold their Sundgau territory (mostly in Upper Alsace) to France in 1646, which had occupied it, for the sum of 1.2 million Thalers. When hostilities were concluded in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia, most of Alsace was recognized as part of France, although some towns remained independent. The treaty stipulations regarding Alsace were complex; although the French king gained sovereignty, existing rights and customs of the inhabitants were largely preserved. France continued to maintain its customs border along the Vosges mountains where it had been, leaving Alsace more economically oriented to neighbouring German-speaking lands. The German language remained in use in local administration, in schools, and at the (Lutheran) University of Strasbourg, which continued to draw students from other German-speaking lands. The 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau, by which the French king ordered the suppression of French Protestantism, was not applied in Alsace. France did endeavour to promote Catholicism; Strasbourg Cathedral, for example, which had been Lutheran from 1524 to 1681, was returned to the Catholic Church. However, compared to the rest of France, Alsace enjoyed a climate of religious tolerance.	This situation prevailed until 1639, when most of Alsace was conquered by France so as to keep it out of the hands of the Spanish Habsburgs, who wanted a clear pathway to access their territories in the Netherlands. The French conquest of Alsace was a turning point in the region's history, as it marked the end of its independence and the beginning of a period of French influence. Under French rule, Alsace experienced significant changes, including the imposition of French language and culture, the introduction of new administrative and legal systems, and the adoption of new economic policies. Despite these changes, however, the people of Alsace maintained a strong sense of regional identity and continued to celebrate their unique cultural heritage.

The cause of the onus was the Hamidian Massacres of Armenians because they were Christians, but it seemed to spill over into the protracted conflicts of the Balkans. For a time, ""Near East"" meant primarily the Balkans. Robert Hichens' book The Near East (1913) is subtitled Dalmatia, Greece and Constantinople."	"In the last years of the 19th century the term ""Near East"" acquired considerable disrepute in eyes of the English-speaking public as did the Ottoman Empire itself. The cause of this disrepute can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the perceived backwardness and corruption of the Ottoman government, the growing influence of European powers in the region, and the increasing attention paid to the plight of Christian minorities in the empire. Additionally, the term ""Near East"" itself came to be seen as outdated and Eurocentric, reflecting a colonialist mentality. Despite these negative attitudes, however, the region continued to be a site of significant geopolitical and economic importance, particularly during the First World War and its aftermath."

According to Capitol Record's A&R, Joe Weinberger, he was approached by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.	According to Capitol Record's A&R, Joe Weinberger, he was approached by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. This decision ultimately led to West signing with Roc-A-Fella Records and launching his successful music career. Weinberger's account highlights the importance of industry connections and decision-making in the music business. Despite the missed opportunity, Capitol Records continued to thrive as a major player in the industry, exemplifying the constant flux and competition that defines the music business landscape.

Precipitation averages less than 15 inches (38 cm). The Southwest is a hot desert, with temperatures exceeding 100 °F (37.8 °C) for several weeks at a time in summer. The Southwest and the Great Basin are also affected by the monsoon from the Gulf of California from July to September, which brings localized but often severe thunderstorms to the region.	The Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (the Intermontane Plateaus) are arid or semiarid regions that lie in the rain shadow of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. Precipitation averages less than 12 inches per year in these regions, making them some of the driest in North America. The Great Basin is characterized by a series of north-south trending mountain ranges separated by flat valleys, while the Columbia Plateau is a large, flat area with occasional buttes and mesas. Despite their harsh climates, these regions are home to unique plant and animal species that have adapted to the arid conditions. Human populations in these areas have also adapted, relying on irrigation and other water management techniques to sustain agriculture and other industries.

"The Bronx's highest elevation at 280 feet (85 m) is in the northwest corner, west of Van Cortlandt Park and in the Chapel Farm area near the Riverdale Country School. The opposite (southeastern) side of the Bronx has four large low peninsulas or ""necks"" of low-lying land that jut into the waters of the East River and were once salt marsh: Hunt's Point, Clason's Point, Screvin's Neck and Throg's Neck. Further up the coastline, Rodman's Neck lies between Pelham Bay Park in the northeast and City Island. The Bronx's irregular shoreline extends for 75 square miles (194 km2)."	The Bronx's highest elevation at 280 feet (85 m) is in the northwest corner, west of Van Cortlandt Park and in the Chapel Farm area near the Riverdale Country School. The Bronx's topography is influenced by its proximity to the Hudson River and the Bronx River, resulting in a diverse landscape of hills, valleys, and wetlands. As the only borough on the mainland, it is home to the city's largest park, Pelham Bay Park, which encompasses over 2,700 acres. The highest point in the Bronx, located in the northwest corner, offers scenic views of the surrounding area, including the nearby Van Cortlandt Park and the Riverdale Country School. Despite its urban setting, the Bronx boasts a variety of natural features that provide opportunities for outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat.

A second New Haven gastronomical claim to fame is Louis' Lunch, which is located in a small brick building on Crown Street and has been serving fast food since 1895. Though fiercely debated, the restaurant's founder Louis Lassen is credited by the Library of Congress with inventing the hamburger and steak sandwich. Louis' Lunch broils hamburgers, steak sandwiches and hot dogs vertically in original antique 1898 cast iron stoves using gridirons, patented by local resident Luigi Pieragostini in 1939, that hold the meat in place while it cooks.	A second New Haven gastronomical claim to fame is Louis' Lunch, which is located in a small brick building on Crown Street and has been serving fast food since 1895. It is widely believed that Louis' Lunch invented the hamburger sandwich. The story goes that in 1900, a customer rushed into the restaurant and requested a quick meal that he could eat on the go. Louis Lassen, the owner, quickly cooked up a blend of ground steak trimmings and served it between two slices of toast. The customer was so pleased with the creation that he returned the next day with friends, and the hamburger sandwich was born. Today, Louis' Lunch still serves its famous burgers on white toast with a choice of cheese, tomato, and onion, and has become a beloved institution in the New Haven community.
