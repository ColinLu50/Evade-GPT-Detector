The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control codes, while the remaining 94 columns (94 positions) were designated for graphic codes. This pattern allowed for efficient processing and recognition of the different types of codes. Additionally, the code was designed to be easily modifiable, with the ability to add or remove codes as needed. These features made the code a practical and versatile tool for programming and data processing tasks.

In October 2003, San Diego was the site of the Cedar Fire, which has been called the largest wildfire in California over the past century. The fire burned 280,000 acres (1,100 km2), killed 15 people, and destroyed more than 2,200 homes. In addition to damage caused by the fire, smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits due to asthma, respiratory problems, eye irritation, and smoke inhalation; the poor air quality caused San Diego County schools to close for a week. Wildfires four years later destroyed some areas, particularly within the communities of Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Santa Fe, and Ramona.	San Diego and its backcountry are subject to periodic wildfires. In October 2003, San Diego was the site of the Cedar Fire, which has been called the largest wildfire in California’s history. The Cedar Fire burned over 280,000 acres and destroyed over 2,200 homes in San Diego County. In addition to the physical damage, the wildfire caused significant economic and social impacts on the affected communities. The aftermath of the Cedar Fire highlighted the need for improved fire prevention and management strategies in San Diego and other fire-prone regions. Efforts to prevent and mitigate the impact of wildfires in San Diego include increasing public awareness, implementing fire-safe building codes, and enhancing early warning and evacuation systems. Despite these efforts, wildfires remain a significant threat to San Diego’s environment, economy, and communities.

The trademarked logo, owned by New York State Empire State Development, appears in souvenir shops and brochures throughout the city and state, some licensed, many not. The song is the state song of New York.	"I Love New York (stylized I ❤ NY) is both a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have been used since 1977 to promote tourism in New York City. The iconic logo was designed by Milton Glaser, an American graphic designer, and features a red heart symbolizing love, with the letters ""I"" and ""NY"" placed inside the heart. The design has become a widely recognizable symbol of New York City and has been imitated and parodied countless times. The accompanying song, ""I Love New York"" was written by Steve Karmen and has been featured in numerous television and radio commercials. The campaign has been credited with helping to revive New York City's struggling tourism industry in the late 1970s and continues to be a prominent aspect of the city's branding and marketing efforts today."

A clear case of amensalism is where sheep or cattle trample grass. Whilst the presence of the grass causes negligible detrimental effects to the animal's hoof, the grass suffers from being crushed. Amensalism is often used to describe strongly asymmetrical competitive interactions, such as has been observed between the Spanish ibex and weevils of the genus Timarcha which feed upon the same type of shrub. Whilst the presence of the weevil has almost no influence on food availability, the presence of ibex has an enormous detrimental effect on weevil numbers, as they consume significant quantities of plant matter and incidentally ingest the weevils upon it.	Amensalism is an interaction where an organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by the other. A clear case of amensalism is where sheep or cattle trample over plants in a pasture, causing damage to the vegetation without receiving any benefit from it. While amensalism may appear to be a one-sided interaction, it can have significant ecological consequences. For instance, the trampled plants may become more vulnerable to disease or herbivory, leading to a cascading effect on other organisms in the ecosystem. Additionally, amensalistic interactions may influence the distribution and abundance of species, as certain organisms may be more susceptible to amensalistic effects than others. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and outcomes of amensalism is crucial for predicting and managing ecological communities.

The administrative county was also the most populous of its type outside London, with a population of 2,280,359 in 1961. On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative county was abolished, as were the county boroughs. The urbanised southern part largely became part of two metropolitan counties, Merseyside and Greater Manchester. The new county of Cumbria incorporates the Furness exclave.	By the census of 1971, the population of Lancashire and its county boroughs had reached 5,129,416, making it the most populous geographic county in the UK. The administrative county was abolished in 1974, and the area was divided into several smaller administrative districts. Despite this restructuring, Lancashire remains a significant contributor to the UK economy, with a diverse range of industries including manufacturing, healthcare, and tourism. The region is also home to several prestigious universities and research institutions, making it a center for academic excellence and innovation. Despite facing challenges such as economic inequality and environmental concerns, Lancashire continues to thrive as a dynamic and resilient region with a rich cultural heritage and a promising future.
Since the armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field, they have a voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor	"Since the armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field, they have a voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called ""back electromotive force (emf)"". The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load."	Since the armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field, they have a voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor ’s current and is known as the back electromotive force (EMF). The magnitude of this back EMF is directly proportional to the speed of the motor and the strength of the magnetic field. When the motor is first turned on, the back EMF is small and the current through the windings is high, resulting in high torque. As the motor speeds up, the back EMF increases and the current decreases, resulting in lower torque. This is why direct-current and universal motors have a speed-torque characteristic curve that is inversely proportional. By controlling the voltage applied to the motor, it is possible to regulate the speed and torque of the motor to suit the requirements of the application.

As a general rule, Haredi Jews believe that when at all possible the law should be maintained as it was understood by their authorities at the haskalah, believing that it had never changed. Modern Orthodox authorities are more willing to assume that under scrupulous examination, identical principles may lead to different applications in the context of modern life. To the Orthodox Jew, halakha is a guide, God's Law, governing the structure of daily life from the moment he or she wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep. It includes codes of behaviour applicable to a broad range of circumstances (and many hypothetical ones). There are though a number of halakhic meta-principles that guide the halakhic process and in an instance of opposition between a specific halakha and a meta-principle, the meta-principle often wins out . Examples of Halakhic Meta-Principles are: ""Deracheha Darchei Noam"" - the ways of Torah are pleasant, ""Kavod Habriyot"" - basic respect for human beings, ""Pikuach Nefesh"" - the sanctity of human life."	However, there is significant disagreement within Orthodox Judaism, particularly between Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism, about the extent and circumstances under which the proper application of Halakha should be observed. While Haredi Judaism emphasizes strict adherence to Halakha and traditional Jewish practices, Modern Orthodox Judaism allows for greater flexibility and adaptation to modern circumstances. This disagreement has led to debates over issues such as gender roles, participation in secular society, and the use of technology. Despite these differences, both Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews share a commitment to the centrality of Halakha in Jewish life and the importance of maintaining a strong connection to Jewish tradition and heritage.

It was between the First Battalion Grenadier Guards and the Second Battalion Scots Fusilier Guards resulting in a win by the Grenadier Guards 3 goals, 2 rouges to nothing.[citation needed] In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football. The game gradually gained a following, with the Hamilton Football Club formed on November 3, 1869, (the oldest football club in Canada). Montreal formed a team April 8, 1872, Toronto was formed on October 4, 1873, and the Ottawa FBC on September 20, 1876.	The first written account of a game played was on October 15, 1862, on the Montreal Cricket Grounds. It was between the First Battalion Grenadier Guards and the Second Battalion Scots Fusilier Guards, both regiments of the British Army stationed in Canada at the time. The game was played according to the rules of the Rugby School in England, which had recently been modified to create a new version of the sport known as rugby football. This historic match was the beginning of a new era in sports and would eventually lead to the development of modern rugby football, which is now played all over the world. The game's popularity quickly spread beyond the military and was adopted by universities and schools in Canada, the United States, and Britain, becoming a beloved sport that continues to capture the hearts of millions of fans today.
The domestication of large animals (c. 8000 BC) resulted in a dramatic increase in social inequality in most of the areas where it occurred; New Guinea being a notable exception.	The domestication of large animals (c. 8000 BC) resulted in a dramatic increase in social inequality in most of the areas where it occurred; New Guinea being a notable exception. Possession of livestock allowed competition between households and resulted in inherited inequalities of wealth. Neolithic pastoralists who controlled large herds gradually acquired more livestock, and this made economic inequalities more pronounced. However, evidence of social inequality is still disputed, as settlements such as Catal Huyuk reveal a striking lack of difference in the size of homes and burial sites, suggesting a more egalitarian society with no evidence of the concept of capital, although some homes do appear slightly larger or more elaborately decorated than others.	The domestication of large animals (c. 8000 BC) resulted in a dramatic increase in social inequality in most of the areas where it occurred; New Guinea being a notable exception. This increase in social inequality was due to the fact that large animals such as horses, cattle, and pigs provided a means of production that could be controlled by a small group of individuals. These individuals were able to accumulate wealth and power by controlling the distribution of these animals and their by-products. In many cases, this led to the formation of hierarchical societies where a small ruling class held power over a larger, lower class. However, in New Guinea, where large animals were not domesticated, social structures remained relatively egalitarian. This suggests that the domestication of large animals played a significant role in shaping the development of human societies.

It is so named because it set the standards by which Greek civilization would be judged in later eras. The Classical period is also described as the ""Golden Age"" of Greek civilization, and its art, philosophy, architecture and literature would be instrumental in the formation and development of Western culture."	The classical period of Greek civilization covers a time spanning from the early 5th century BC to the death of Alexander the Great, in 323 BC (some authors prefer to extend it until the end of the Hellenistic period, in 31 BC). During this time, Greece underwent significant political, cultural, and intellectual developments that have had a lasting impact on Western civilization. This period saw the rise of Athens as a dominant city-state, the invention of democracy, the flourishing of philosophy, art, and literature, and the emergence of influential figures such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. The classical Greek legacy can be seen in various fields, from architecture and sculpture to mathematics and science, and continues to inspire and inform contemporary culture and thought.

Rhyme, while found throughout the Quran, is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras, in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence. The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers. Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion. Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository."	"The language of the Quran has been described as ""rhymed prose"" as it partakes of both poetry and prose; however, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the full complexity and richness of the Quranic language. The Quran is a highly sophisticated and intricate text that employs a wide range of rhetorical devices and linguistic strategies to convey its message. For example, the Quran frequently uses repetition, parallelism, and imagery to create a powerful and memorable effect. Additionally, the language of the Quran is marked by a high degree of syntactic and semantic ambiguity, which allows for multiple interpretations and levels of meaning. This complexity and richness of the Quranic language has been the subject of extensive study and analysis by scholars of Arabic literature and linguistics."

US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes; however, banks levy an exchange rate fee for the purchase of US dollars with Bermudian dollars. Bermudian notes carry the image of Queen Elizabeth II. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the issuing authority for all banknotes and coins, and regulates financial institutions. The Royal Naval Dockyard Museum holds a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes and coins.	In 1970 the country switched its currency from the Bermudian pound to the Bermudian dollar, which is pegged at par with the US dollar. US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins, making it a widely accepted form of currency on the island. This move allowed Bermuda to have greater control over its monetary policy, while also aligning itself with the stability of the US economy. The switch to the Bermudian dollar also facilitated trade and tourism, as it eliminated the need for currency exchange between the two countries. Today, the Bermudian dollar continues to serve as the country's official currency and plays a crucial role in its economy.

War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In diffusion, the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, hamburgers, fast food in the United States, seemed exotic when introduced into China. ""Stimulus diffusion"" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. ""Direct Borrowing"" on the other hand tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. Diffusion of innovations theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products."	Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social organization, leading to changes in cultural norms and values. For example, the introduction of firearms to indigenous societies during colonialism had a significant impact on their way of life and traditional practices. Similarly, the global spread of Western media has led to the adoption of new fashion trends and music genres in non-Western societies. In contrast, the isolation of certain communities may preserve traditional cultural practices for longer periods of time. Therefore, the interaction and communication between cultures have a profound impact on the evolution of cultural practices and beliefs.

The halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. Fiber-optic lamps for optical microscopy is one typical application.	The halogen lamp reduces uneven evaporation of the filament and eliminates darkening of the envelope by filling the lamp with a halogen gas at low pressure, rather than an inert gas like nitrogen or argon. This halogen gas reacts with the evaporated tungsten atoms, forming tungsten halides that are transported back to the filament surface. These halides then decompose, releasing the tungsten atoms back onto the filament surface. This process, known as the halogen cycle, allows the filament to operate at a higher temperature and for a longer period of time, resulting in a brighter and more efficient lamp. Additionally, halogen lamps have a more natural color temperature and a longer lifespan than traditional incandescent lamps. However, they also generate more heat and require careful handling due to their high operating temperatures.

This, coupled with the popularity of the private automobile after 1945, led to the auto-centric urban structure now present today in the middle and outer suburbs. Much of metropolitan Melbourne is accordingly characterised by low density sprawl, whilst its inner city areas feature predominantly medium-density, transit-oriented urban forms. The city centre, Docklands, St. Kilda Road and Southbank areas feature high-density forms.	Melbourne is typical of Australian capital cities in that after the turn of the 20th century, it expanded with the underlying notion of a 'quarter acre home and garden' for each family. This notion was a product of the post-war era and the desire for suburbanization and home ownership. As a result, Melbourne's urban sprawl grew rapidly and the city's population boomed. Today, the city continues to expand, with new suburbs being developed on the outskirts of the metropolitan area. However, this expansion has come at a cost, with concerns about urban sprawl, traffic congestion, and the loss of green spaces. Despite these challenges, Melbourne remains a vibrant and diverse city, known for its cultural attractions, world-class restaurants, and thriving arts scene.

All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven	In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma-ray bursts are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.	In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma-ray bursts are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by the process of nuclear fusion, which involves the conversion of lighter elements into heavier ones, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process. Novae and supernovae are the explosive deaths of stars, which can outshine entire galaxies for brief periods of time, and are responsible for the production of many of the heavy elements in the universe. Quasars and gamma-ray bursts are even more energetic events, associated with the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. These phenomena provide important clues about the evolution of the universe and the nature of its most extreme environments.

While there were to be a few hits like The Killers (1946) and The Naked City (1948), Universal-International's new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office. By the late 1940s, Goetz was out, and the studio returned to low-budget films. The inexpensive Francis (1950), the first film of a series about a talking mule and Ma and Pa Kettle (1949), part of a series, became mainstays of the company. Once again, the films of Abbott and Costello, including Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948), were among the studio's top-grossing productions. But at this point Rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor Milton Rackmil, whose Decca Records would take full control of Universal in 1952. Besides Abbott and Costello, the studio retained the Walter Lantz cartoon studio, whose product was released with Universal-International's films.	The production arm of the studio still struggled. While there were to be a few hits like The Killers (1946) and The Naked City (1948), Universal-International's new theatrical films often failed to recoup their budgets. This was largely due to a lack of originality in the studio's output, as they relied heavily on remakes and adaptations of popular novels or plays. Additionally, there was a general lack of direction and cohesion in the studio's overall strategy. However, Universal-International continued to find success in other areas, such as their television division and their distribution of foreign films in the US market. Despite these challenges, the studio remained a major player in the film industry throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s.

Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading it.	Whitehall's disquiet at the failures of the RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with Sholto Douglas on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing a new command structure that aimed to improve the RAF's performance. However, this move proved to be controversial, as it was perceived by some as a scapegoating of Dowding, who was widely respected for his leadership during the Battle of Britain. Despite this, Douglas was able to implement changes that led to a more effective use of resources and better coordination between different units within the RAF. This ultimately helped to turn the tide of the war in the air in favor of the Allies, and secure a crucial victory in the Battle of Britain.

He died just as a Mass for him finished in Saint Peter's Square below, celebrated by Luigi Traglia. After he died, his brow was ritually tapped to see if he was dead, and those with him in the room said prayers. Then the room was illuminated, thus informing the people of what had happened. He was buried on 6 June in the Vatican grottos. Two wreaths, placed on the two sides of his tomb, were donated by the prisoners of the Regina Coeli prison and the Mantova jail in Verona. On 22 June 1963, one day after his friend and successor Pope Paul VI was elected, the latter prayed at his tomb.	"John XXIII died of peritonitis caused by a perforated stomach at 19:49 local time on 3 June 1963 at the age of 81, ending a historic pontificate of four years and seven months. His death came as a shock to the Catholic world, as he was highly regarded for his progressive and inclusive approach to the Church. During his pontificate, he initiated the Second Vatican Council, which introduced significant reforms to the Church's liturgy, governance, and relations with other religions. He also worked tirelessly to promote social justice and peace, earning him the title ""Good Pope John."" Despite his relatively short tenure as pope, John XXIII left an indelible mark on the Catholic Church, and his legacy continues to inspire Catholics around the world."

This process of agriculture-driven expansion led to the development of the first forms of government in agricultural centers, such as the Fertile Crescent, Ancient India, Ancient China, Olmec, Sub-Saharan Africa and Norte Chico.	As the number and size of agricultural societies increased, they expanded into lands traditionally used by hunter-gatherers. This process of agriculture-driven expansion led to the development of the first forms of territoriality, as societies sought to claim and defend their newly acquired agricultural lands. This often resulted in conflict and displacement of hunter-gatherer populations, who were forced to either assimilate into the agricultural society or move to less desirable areas. The growth of agriculture also brought about significant changes in social organization, such as the emergence of hierarchical structures and the development of specialized occupations. These changes laid the foundation for the complex societies and civilizations that would emerge in the millennia to come.

In Greater Manchester the successor boroughs were Bury, Bolton, Manchester, Oldham (part), Rochdale, Salford, Tameside (part), Trafford (part) and Wigan. Warrington and Widnes, south of the new Merseyside/Greater Manchester border were added to the new non-metropolitan county of Cheshire. The urban districts of Barnoldswick and Earby, Bowland Rural District and the parishes of Bracewell and Brogden and Salterforth from Skipton Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire became part of the new Lancashire. One parish, Simonswood, was transferred from the borough of Knowsley in Merseyside to the district of West Lancashire in 1994. In 1998 Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen became independent unitary authorities.	The boroughs of Liverpool, Knowsley, St Helens and Sefton were included in Merseyside. In Greater Manchester the successor boroughs were Bury, Bolton, Manchester, Oldham (part), Rochdale, Salford, Tameside (part), Trafford and Wigan. Both Merseyside and Greater Manchester are located in the North West region of England and are known for their industrial heritage and cultural landmarks. Merseyside is home to the famous Liverpool docks and the Beatles museum, while Greater Manchester boasts the iconic Manchester Cathedral and the world-renowned Manchester United Football Club.

The only way to do this was to destroy the U.S. Fifth Fleet, which had 15 fleet carriers and 956 planes, 7 battleships, 28 submarines, and 69 destroyers, as well as several light and heavy cruisers. Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa attacked with nine-tenths of Japan's fighting fleet, which included nine carriers with 473 planes, 5 battleships, several cruisers, and 28 destroyers. Ozawa's pilots were outnumbered 2:1 and their aircraft were becoming or were already obsolete. The Japanese had considerable antiaircraft defenses but lacked proximity fuzes or good radar. With the odds against him, Ozawa devised an appropriate strategy. His planes had greater range because they were not weighed down with protective armor; they could attack at about 480 km (300 mi)[citation needed], and could search a radius of 900 km[citation needed] (560 mi). U.S. Navy Hellcat fighters could only attack within 200 miles (320 km) and only search within a 325-mile (523 km)[citation needed] radius. Ozawa planned to use this advantage by positioning his fleet 300 miles (480 km)[citation needed] out. The Japanese planes would hit the U.S. carriers, land at Guam to refuel, then hit the enemy again when returning to their carriers. Ozawa also counted on about 500 land-based planes at Guam and other islands.	It was imperative for Japanese commanders to hold Saipan. The only way to do this was to destroy the U.S. Fifth Fleet, which had 15 fleet carriers and 956 planes, as it was the main force that could launch an invasion of the island. Additionally, losing Saipan would mean losing control of the central Pacific and the ability to defend Japan's mainland. The Japanese commanders knew that the battle for Saipan would be crucial in determining the outcome of the war in the Pacific, and they were willing to take extreme measures to ensure victory. Despite their efforts, the Japanese were ultimately unsuccessful in holding Saipan, and the battle marked a turning point in the war.

Also, in resolving political hostilities with the German emperor Frederick III of Habsburg, he invaded his western domains. Matthew organized the Black Army of mercenary soldiers; it was considered as the biggest army of its time. Using this powerful tool, the Hungarian king led wars against the Turkish armies and stopped the Ottomans during his reign. After the death of Matthew, and with end of the Black Army, the Ottoman Empire grew in strength and Central Europe was defenseless. At the Battle of Mohács, the forces of the Ottoman Empire annihilated the Hungarian army and Louis II of Hungary drowned in the Csele Creek while trying to escape. The leader of the Hungarian army, Pál Tomori, also died in the battle. This is considered to be one of the final battles of Medieval times.	King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary (1458–1490) was one of the most prominent figures of the period, directing campaigns to the West, conquering Bohemia in answer to the Pope's call for a crusade against the Hussites, and establishing a powerful central government. He was a patron of the arts, science, and literature, and his court was known for its intellectual and cultural achievements. Under his rule, Hungary became a major player in European politics and trade, with alliances and treaties with neighboring states. However, his reign was also marked by a strong authoritarian streak, with harsh punishments for dissent and a centralized bureaucracy that often stifled local autonomy. Overall, King Matthias Corvinus left a lasting legacy as a dynamic and influential leader who shaped Hungary's place in the wider world.

Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism, attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights. He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the ""irrational impieties"" of Christian doctrine. His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate, with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in 363 in Persia, after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned.

"Constantine's nephew Julian rejected the ""Galilean madness"" of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism, Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult. Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but unsuccessfully sought to restore the traditional pagan religion of Rome, which had been suppressed by his uncle's Christianizing policies. He issued edicts reversing Christian legislation, attempted to rebuild pagan temples, and even attempted to revive animal sacrifices. However, his reign was cut short when he died in battle against the Sassanid Empire in 363. Despite his short reign, Julian's attempt to revive paganism highlighted the ongoing tension between the traditional religions of Rome and the rise of Christianity in the late Roman Empire."

Several expeditions were led to find a shorter route from Santa Barbara to New Mexico. In April 1598, Juan de Oñate finally found a short route from Santa Barbara to New Mexico which came to be called El Paso del Norte (The Northern Pass). The discovery of El Paso Del Norte was important for the expansion of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (The Inner Land Royal Road) to link Spanish settlements in New Mexico to Mexico City; El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro facilitated transport of settlers and supplies to New Mexico.	Santa Bárbara became the launching place for expeditions into New Mexico by Spanish conquistadors like: Antonio de Espejo, Gaspar Castaño, Antonio Gutiérrez de Umaña, Francisco Leyba de Bonilla, and Vicente de Zaldívar. These expeditions were primarily focused on expanding Spanish territorial claims and spreading Catholicism, but they also resulted in the discovery of valuable resources such as gold, silver, and copper. Santa Bárbara, situated near the Rio Grande, provided a strategic location for these expeditions to set out from, as it allowed for easy access to both the river and the surrounding desert regions. The success of these early expeditions paved the way for further Spanish exploration and colonization of the New Mexico region, ultimately leading to the establishment of Santa Fe as the capital of the province.

Meanwhile, the Liberal Party declined rapidly, and the party also suffered a catastrophic split which allowed the Labour Party to gain much of the Liberals' support. With the Liberals thus in disarray, Labour won 142 seats in 1922, making it the second largest political group in the House of Commons and the official opposition to the Conservative government. After the election the now-rehabilitated Ramsay MacDonald was voted the first official leader of the Labour Party.	The Communist Party of Great Britain was refused affiliation to the Labour Party between 1921 and 1923. Meanwhile, the Liberal Party declined rapidly, and the party also suffered a catastrophic split in 1931 when a group of MPs broke away to form the National Labour Organisation. This left the Labour Party as the main opposition to the Conservative Party, and it became increasingly important for Labour to establish a clear identity and message. The party's response to the economic crisis of the 1930s was to call for state intervention and a redistribution of wealth through taxation, which eventually led to the implementation of the welfare state and the nationalisation of key industries after World War II. Despite facing challenges from within and without, the Labour Party emerged from the interwar period as a formidable force in British politics.

In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46 BC, Caesar was given censorial powers, which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised the membership of the Senate to 900. This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him.	Caesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, meaning that he was immune from physical harm and his decisions could not be legally challenged. Furthermore, it gave him the authority to propose legislation and veto any decision made by the Senate. This consolidation of power allowed Caesar to effectively govern Rome and its territories as a virtual monarch. It also sparked resentment among the aristocratic class, who saw Caesar's actions as a threat to the traditional Roman Republic. Ultimately, this tension would lead to Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, marking the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire.
"The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke ""a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America"" and in his diary recorded: ""Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine""."	"The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke ""a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America"" and in his diary recorded: ""Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine"". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: ""I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton"". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved ""a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site"". Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a manifesto for Conservative thinking."	"The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke ""a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America"" and in his diary recorded: ""Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine"". Gladstone's admiration for Burke's political philosophy and insights on Ireland and America highlights the significant influence Burke had on political thought during the 19th century. As a prominent figure of the conservative movement, Burke's ideas on the importance of tradition, gradual change, and the role of government in society were highly influential in shaping political discourse both in his time and beyond. Gladstone's recognition of Burke's enduring wisdom suggests that his ideas continue to resonate with contemporary political debates, underscoring the lasting relevance of Burke's contributions to political theory."

On September 29, 1914, Japanese troops occupied the Enewetak Atoll, and on September 30, 1914, the Jaluit Atoll, the administrative centre of the Marshall Islands. After the war, on June 28, 1919, Germany signed (under protest) the Treaty of Versailles. It renounced all of its Pacific possessions, including the Marshall Islands. On December 17, 1920, the Council of the League of Nations approved the South Pacific Mandate for Japan to take over all former German colonies in the Pacific Ocean located north of the Equator. The Administrative Centre of the Marshall Islands archipelago remained Jaluit.	In 1914, Japan joined the Entente during World War I and captured various German Empire colonies, including several in Micronesia. On September 29, 1914, Japanese troops occupied the Enewetak Atoll, which is part of the Marshall Islands in Micronesia. This move marked Japan's first military action in the Pacific during World War I. The capture of these colonies allowed Japan to expand its sphere of influence in the Pacific and gain access to valuable resources such as coal, phosphate, and guano. Japan's involvement in the war ultimately led to its emergence as a major world power and set the stage for its future expansionist policies in Asia. However, Japan's actions in Micronesia also had significant implications for the local populations, as they experienced forced labor, land seizures, and cultural assimilation under Japanese rule.

China also joined the Allies, as eventually did most of the rest of the world. China was in turmoil at the time, and attacked Japanese armies through guerilla-type warfare. By the beginning of 1942, the major combatants were aligned as follows: the British Commonwealth, the United States, and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany and Italy; and the British Commonwealth, China, and the United States were fighting Japan. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China were referred as a ""trusteeship of the powerful"" during the World War II  and were recognized as the Allied ""Big Four"" in Declaration by United Nations These four countries were considered as the ""Four Policemen"" or ""Four Sheriffs"" of the Allies power and primary victors of World War II. From then through August 1945, battles raged across all of Europe, in the North Atlantic Ocean, across North Africa, throughout Southeast Asia, throughout China, across the Pacific Ocean and in the air over Japan."	On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, bringing it too into the war on the Allied side. China also joined the Allies, as eventually did the Soviet Union. This marked a turning point in the Second World War, as the United States' involvement and support was instrumental in securing the eventual victory of the Allied forces. The attack on Pearl Harbor was a devastating blow to the United States, resulting in the loss of over 2,400 American lives and significant damage to the naval base. However, it also served as a catalyst for the country to fully engage in the war effort and mobilize its resources to defeat the Axis powers. The involvement of China and the Soviet Union further strengthened the Allied cause, as their vast populations and military capabilities contributed significantly to the eventual defeat of the Axis powers.

Robert Holmes à Court, another Australian magnate had previously tried to buy The Times in 1980.	Several suitors appeared, including Robert Maxwell, Tiny Rowland and Lord Rothermere; however, only one buyer was in a position to meet the full Thomson remit, Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Maxwell, Rowland, and Rothermere were all highly regarded contenders for the acquisition of Thomson's media assets. Nevertheless, despite their considerable resources and experience in the field, only Murdoch was able to satisfy the comprehensive requirements set forth by the Thomson family. As an accomplished media mogul in his own right, Murdoch's business acumen and financial standing enabled him to secure the deal, cementing his status as a formidable force in the industry.
A third concern with the Kinsey scale is that it inappropriately measures heterosexuality and homosexuality on the same scale, making one a tradeoff of the other. Research in the 1970s	A third concern with the Kinsey scale is that it inappropriately measures heterosexuality and homosexuality on the same scale, making one a tradeoff of the other. Research in the 1970s on masculinity and femininity found that concepts of masculinity and femininity are more appropriately measured as independent concepts on a separate scale rather than as a single continuum, with each end representing opposite extremes. When compared on the same scale, they act as tradeoffs such, whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa. However, if they are considered as separate dimensions one can be simultaneously very masculine and very feminine. Similarly, considering heterosexuality and homosexuality on separate scales would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual or not very much of either. When they are measured independently, the degree of heterosexual and homosexual can be independently determined, rather than the balance between heterosexual and homosexual as determined using the Kinsey Scale.	A third concern with the Kinsey scale is that it inappropriately measures heterosexuality and homosexuality on the same scale, making one a tradeoff of the other. Research in the 1970s and 1980s showed that sexual orientation is more complex than a simple dichotomy between heterosexual and homosexual. Instead, sexual orientation can be better understood as a multidimensional construct that includes various components such as attraction, behavior, and identity. Additionally, the Kinsey scale fails to account for individuals who identify as bisexual or pansexual, as it only offers a limited range of options. Therefore, the Kinsey scale may not accurately represent the diversity of sexual orientations that exist, and may perpetuate the binary thinking that has historically marginalized non-normative sexual identities.

There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.	Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the early 19th century, the scientific community remained largely skeptical of these theories. However, with the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, the scientific community was presented with a comprehensive and compelling theory of evolution through natural selection. Darwin's work revolutionized the field of biology, and has since become widely accepted as the foundation of modern evolutionary theory. Nevertheless, debates about the mechanisms and processes of evolution continue to this day, and scientists continue to study and refine our understanding of the origins and development of life on Earth.

Some manufacturers have started using a new, significantly more environmentally friendly alternative to expanded plastic packaging. Made out of paper, and known commercially as paperfoam, the new packaging has very low carbon emissions and is biodegradable. It is also lightweight, yet sturdy enough to protect fragile items during shipping. Paperfoam is made from a blend of renewable resources, including potato starch, water, and cellulose fiber. The production process involves minimal energy consumption, and the resulting material can be recycled up to seven times. With the increasing demand for sustainable packaging solutions, paperfoam represents a promising option for reducing the negative impact of packaging waste on the environment.

In ordinary use, as when speaking of Woodrow Wilson's political idealism, it generally suggests the priority of ideals, principles, values, and goals over concrete realities. Idealists are understood to represent the world as it might or should be, unlike pragmatists, who focus on the world as it presently is. In the arts, similarly, idealism affirms imagination and attempts to realize a mental conception of beauty, a standard of perfection, juxtaposed to aesthetic naturalism and realism."	"Idealism is a term with several related meanings. It comes via idea from the Greek idein (ἰδεῖν), meaning ""to see"". The term entered the English language by 1743. In ordinary usage, idealism refers to a belief in the existence of a perfect or ideal world, often contrasted with the flawed reality we experience. In philosophy, idealism is a metaphysical theory that holds that reality is ultimately constituted by the mind or by ideas. This theory asserts that the physical world is not the only reality, and that there are non-physical entities, such as thoughts, emotions, and values, that are just as real. Idealism has been influential in many areas of philosophy, including epistemology, ethics, and political theory. It has also been a subject of criticism and debate, with some arguing that it is an unrealistic or even dangerous view of the world."

Compared to general-service bulbs, for the same power, these bulbs produce far more light, and (more importantly) light at a higher color temperature, at the expense of greatly reduced life (which may be as short as two hours for a type P1 lamp). The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point, 3,695 K (6,191 °F). A 50-hour-life projection bulb, for instance, is designed to operate only 50 °C (122 °F) below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt, compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp.	In flood lamps used for photographic lighting, the tradeoff is made in the other direction. Compared to general-service bulbs, for the same power, these bulbs produce far more light, and thus have a higher lumen output. However, this comes at the cost of a shorter lifespan and higher heat output. The increased light output is necessary for photographers who need to properly illuminate their subjects, and the heat output can be managed with proper ventilation and cooling systems. Therefore, in the specific context of photographic lighting, flood lamps are a valuable tool despite their drawbacks.

The whale shark, the world's largest species of fish and 6 species of sea turtles can also be found in the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean territories of the Philippines."	The shallow waters of the Southeast Asian coral reefs have the highest levels of biodiversity for the world's marine ecosystems, where coral, fish and molluscs abound. According to Conservation International, the region is home to over 600 species of coral, which is almost 75% of the world's total. Additionally, the coral reefs support more than 3,000 species of fish and invertebrates, making it a critical habitat for many marine species. The Southeast Asian coral reefs also provide other ecosystem services, such as food and income for local communities, coastal protection, and tourism. However, these reefs are under threat from climate change, overfishing, and pollution, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this valuable ecosystem.

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the wiec, an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.	Concerning the early Polish tribes, geography contributed to long-standing traditions. The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the wiec, an assembly of free men. This political structure was heavily influenced by the geography of the region, as the scattered nature of the tribes necessitated a system of local governance. Additionally, the harsh climate and limited resources of the region fostered a culture of self-sufficiency and communal cooperation, which further reinforced the importance of the wiec as a symbol of unity and strength. Overall, the geography of early Poland played a significant role in shaping the social, political, and religious traditions of the region's tribes.

Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust (in Schindler's List), the transatlantic slave trade (in Amistad), war (in Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Bridge of Spies) and terrorism (in Munich). His other films include Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones film series, and A.I. Artificial Intelligence.	In a career spanning more than four decades, Spielberg's films have covered many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood blockbuster cinema, with their high production values, thrilling action sequences, and iconic characters. However, as his career progressed, Spielberg began to explore more serious and complex themes, such as the Holocaust in Schindler's List and the Cold War in Bridge of Spies. He also delved into historical dramas, biopics, and even animated films. Despite the diversity of his filmography, Spielberg's unique directorial style and his ability to tell engaging and emotionally resonant stories have made him one of the most influential filmmakers of his generation.

On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, and Rafael Márquez, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.	After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the revival of FC Barcelona's fortunes. Laporta and Rijkaard were able to create a successful team by developing a strong core of home-grown talent, led by the likes of Lionel Messi, Xavi, and Andres Iniesta, and supplementing it with shrewd signings from around the world. This strategy paid dividends, as Barcelona won both domestic and European titles, including the coveted Champions League trophy, in the years that followed. The Laporta-Rijkaard era is widely considered to be a golden age for Barcelona, and their legacy can still be seen in the team's playing style and philosophy today.

The Borders chain was based in the city, as was its flagship store until it closed in September 2011. Domino's Pizza's headquarters is near Ann Arbor on Domino's Farms, a 271-acre (110 ha) Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired complex just northeast of the city. Another Ann Arbor-based company is Zingerman's Delicatessen, which serves sandwiches and has developed businesses under a variety of brand names. Zingerman's has grown into a family of companies which offers a variety of products (bake shop, mail order, creamery, coffee) and services (business education). Flint Ink Corp., another Ann Arbor-based company, was the world's largest privately held ink manufacturer until it was acquired by Stuttgart-based XSYS Print Solutions in October 2005. Avfuel, a global supplier of aviation fuels and services, is also headquartered in Ann Arbor. Aastrom Biosciences, a publicly traded company that develops stem cell treatments for cardiovascular diseases, is headquartered in Ann Arbor.	Borders Books, started in Ann Arbor, was opened by brothers Tom and Louis Borders in 1971 with a stock of used books. The Borders chain was based in the city, and it quickly became known for its extensive selection of books and knowledgeable staff. The company's success was due in part to its innovative approach to retailing, which included offering a comfortable and inviting atmosphere for customers to browse and read, as well as a strong focus on customer service. The company's expansion into new markets and its embrace of new technologies like e-books helped to solidify its position as a leading bookseller. However, Borders filed for bankruptcy in 2011, unable to compete with the rise of online retailers like Amazon and the changing landscape of the book industry. Despite its ultimate demise, Borders left a lasting legacy in the world of bookselling and retail innovation.

Their loyalty was first and foremost to Catholic Christendom, but when they professed an ethnic identity, they referred to themselves as ""Slovin"" and ""Illyrian"" (a sort of forerunner of Catholic baroque pan-Slavism) and Croat – these 30-odd writers over the span of c. 350 years always saw themselves as Croats first and never as part of a Serbian nation. It should also be noted that, in the pre-national era, Catholic religious orientation did not necessarily equate with Croat ethnic identity in Dalmatia. A Croatian follower of Vuk Karadžić, Ivan Broz, noted that for a Dalmatian to identify oneself as a Serb was seen as foreign as identifying oneself as Macedonian or Greek. Vatroslav Jagić pointed out in 1864:"	However, most intellectuals and writers from Dalmatia who used the Štokavian dialect and practiced the Catholic faith saw themselves as part of a Croatian nation as far back as the 19th century. They viewed language and religion as defining characteristics of their national identity, and rejected the notion of being part of a larger Serbian nation. In addition, the cultural and historical ties to Croatia, as well as the influence of Croatian literature and politics, further strengthened their sense of belonging to the Croatian nation. As a result, the Štokavian dialect became the basis for the standardized Croatian language, and the Catholic Church played a significant role in the cultural and political development of the Croatian nation.

There is a long tradition of Roman Catholic Marian art and no image permeates Catholic art as does the image of Madonna and Child. The icon of the Virgin Theotokos with Christ is without doubt the most venerated icon in the Orthodox Church. Both Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians venerate images and icons of Mary, given that the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 permitted their veneration with the understanding that those who venerate the image are venerating the reality of the person it represents, and the 842 Synod of Constantinople confirming the same. According to Orthodox piety and traditional practice, however, believers ought to pray before and venerate only flat, two-dimensional icons, and not three-dimensional statues.	Devotions to artistic depictions of Mary vary among Christian traditions. There is a long tradition of Roman Catholic Marian art and no image permeates Catholic art as does the image of the Virgin Mary. This is in contrast to Protestant traditions, which tend to have a more reserved approach to the use of religious imagery. While there are some Protestant denominations that incorporate depictions of Mary in their religious artwork, it is not as prominent as in Catholicism. Additionally, Eastern Orthodox Christianity has a rich history of Marian art, with depictions of Mary as the Theotokos (God-bearer) being central to their religious iconography. Overall, the use of artistic depictions of Mary reflects the diversity of Christian traditions and the different ways in which they approach their religious beliefs and practices.

Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as ""jumps"" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of control flow)."	Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be fetched from memory 100 instructions ahead. However, it is important to note that the program counter must always point to the next instruction in memory, and care must be taken to ensure that any changes made to the program counter are valid and do not cause the program to execute incorrectly. Additionally, the program counter can be affected by branching instructions, which allow the program to jump to a different location in memory based on some condition. Overall, the program counter is a fundamental component of the instruction execution cycle and plays a crucial role in determining the flow of a program's execution.

Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion	Greeks from Cyprus have a similar history of emigration, usually to the English-speaking world because of the island's colonization by the British Empire. Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, while the population decreased between mid-1974 and 1977 as a result of emigration, war losses, and a temporary decline in fertility. After the ethnic cleansing of a third of the Greek population of the island in 1974, there was also an increase in the number of Greek Cypriots leaving, especially for the Middle East, which contributed to a decrease in population that tapered off in the 1990s. Today more than two-thirds of the Greek population in Cyprus is urban.	Greeks from Cyprus have a similar history of emigration, usually to the English-speaking world because of the island's colonization by the British Empire. Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion of 1974, which resulted in the displacement of thousands of Greek Cypriots from their homes in the northern part of the island. As a result, many Greek Cypriots resettled in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United States. This diaspora has had a significant impact on the Greek-Cypriot community, as it has led to the formation of large Greek-Cypriot communities in these countries and the preservation of their cultural identity. Moreover, these communities have established strong networks that have allowed for the exchange of ideas, resources, and support, contributing to the economic and social development of both the host and home countries.

In a handbook he addressed to ""all samurai, regardless of rank"" he told his followers that a warrior's only duty in life was to ""...grasp the long and the short swords and to die"". He also ordered his followers to put forth great effort in studying the military classics, especially those related to loyalty and filial piety. He is best known for his quote: ""If a man does not investigate into the matter of Bushido daily, it will be difficult for him to die a brave and manly death. Thus it is essential to engrave this business of the warrior into one's mind well."""	Katō Kiyomasa was one of the most powerful and well-known lords of the Sengoku Era. He commanded most of Japan's major clans during the invasion of Korea (1592–1598). In a ddition to his military prowess, Kiyomasa was also renowned for his cultural contributions, particularly in the areas of tea ceremony and calligraphy. He built several temples and shrines, including the famous Kumamoto Castle, which still stands today as a testament to his architectural skills. Despite his many achievements, Kiyomasa was also known for his ruthless tactics and is rumored to have ordered the execution of prisoners of war, leaving a controversial legacy in Japanese history.

"In 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theatre of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking Massacre (the ""Rape of Nanking""). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event."	In 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theatre of World War II). The conflict lasted until 1945 and resulted in millions of casualties, widespread destruction, and significant political and social changes in both China and Japan. The war was marked by brutal atrocities committed by the Japanese military, including the infamous Rape of Nanking in 1937. The conflict also had a profound impact on international relations, as it contributed to the growing tensions between Japan and the Western powers, which would eventually lead to Japan's entry into the larger global conflict of World War II.

Each region performed separate evaluations. Nintendo of America also maintained a policy that, among other things, limited the amount of violence in the games on its systems. One game, Mortal Kombat, would challenge this policy. A surprise hit in arcades in 1992, Mortal Kombat features splashes of blood and finishing moves that often depict one character dismembering the other. Because the Genesis version retained the gore while the SNES version did not, it outsold the SNES version by a ratio of three or four-to-one.	The company continued to carefully review submitted titles, giving them scores using a 40-point scale and allocating Nintendo's marketing resources accordingly. Each region performed separate evaluations. Nintendo of America also considered factors such as market trends, consumer demographics, and the competitive landscape when making allocation decisions. In addition, the company closely monitored feedback from focus groups and game reviewers to gauge potential success. This rigorous evaluation process allowed Nintendo to effectively target its marketing efforts and maximize the potential success of each title. Ultimately, the company's commitment to strategic evaluation and allocation of resources played a critical role in its ability to maintain a strong presence in the highly competitive video game industry.

Sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent Intellect. The first knowledge of the flying person would be ""I am,"" affirming his or her essence. That essence could not be the body, obviously, as the flying person has no sensation. Thus, the knowledge that ""I am"" is the core of a human being: the soul exists and is self-aware. Avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing, and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms, but as a primary given, a substance. The body is unnecessary; in relation to it, the soul is its perfection. In itself, the soul is an immaterial substance."	However, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation. Sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent Intellect. The first knowledge of the soul is through sensation, which allows it to form a representation of the external world. This representation is then processed in the brain, where reason and intellect interact with it to form rational concepts. Avicenna's theory of the interaction between reason and sensation provided a revolutionary understanding of the relationship between the mind and the body, which has had a significant impact on the development of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience.

The OKL did not oppose the strategic bombardment of enemy industries and or cities, and believed it could greatly affect the balance of power on the battlefield in Germany's favour by disrupting production and damaging civilian morale, but they did not believe that air power alone could be decisive. Contrary to popular belief, the Luftwaffe did not have a systematic policy of what became known as ""terror bombing"". Evidence suggests that the Luftwaffe did not adopt an official bombing policy in which civilians became the primary target until 1942."	Within the Luftwaffe, there was a more muted view of strategic bombing. The OKL did not oppose the strategic bombardment of enemy industries and or cities, and believed it could be effective in disrupting the war effort. However, some senior officers, such as General Adolf Galland, argued that the focus on bombing civilian targets was immoral and counterproductive. Galland believed that the Luftwaffe should instead focus on targeting military installations and infrastructure, which would have a more direct impact on the enemy's ability to wage war. Despite these differing views, the Luftwaffe pursued a strategy of both strategic bombing and targeted attacks on military sites throughout the war. This approach ultimately proved unsuccessful, as Allied air superiority and the increasing effectiveness of anti-aircraft defenses made it difficult for the Luftwaffe to achieve its objectives.

A decisive moment came when 'chymistry' was distinguished from alchemy by Robert Boyle in his work The Sceptical Chymist, in 1661; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work. Other important steps included the gravimetric experimental practices of medical chemists like William Cullen, Joseph Black, Torbern Bergman and Pierre Macquer and through the work of Antoine Lavoisier (Father of Modern Chemistry) on oxygen and the law of conservation of mass, which refuted phlogiston theory. The theory that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by John Dalton in 1803, although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven. Dalton also formulated the law of mass relationships. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev composed his periodic table of elements on the basis of Dalton's discoveries.	"Modern chemistry emerged from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy, medicine, manufacturing and mining. A decisive moment came when 'chymistry' was recognized as a distinct field of study in the seventeenth century, with the development of the scientific method and the publication of seminal works such as Robert Boyle's ""The Sceptical Chymist"" in 1661. This led to the establishment of chemistry as a rigorous scientific discipline, with a focus on the study of matter and its transformations. Over the centuries, chemistry has contributed to numerous advances in fields such as medicine, agriculture, energy production, and materials science, and continues to be a vital area of research and innovation."

During that year Eisenhower's memoir, Crusade in Europe, was published. Critics regarded it as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs, and it was a major financial success as well. Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate. This ruling saved Eisenhower about $400,000.	In 1948, Eisenhower became President of Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City. The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction. During his tenure, Eisenhower worked to improve the university's financial stability by increasing its endowment and expanding its academic programs. He also advocated for the importance of liberal arts education and encouraged the integration of women and minorities into the university community. However, his time at Columbia was cut short when he was called back into military service to serve as the Supreme Commander of NATO forces in Europe. Despite the briefness of his tenure, Eisenhower's impact on Columbia was significant and his leadership helped to shape the university's future direction.

Behaviors showing rhythms include leaf movement, growth, germination, stomatal/gas exchange, enzyme activity, photosynthetic activity, and fragrance emission, among others. Circadian rhythms occur as a plant entrains to synchronize with the light cycle of its surrounding environment. These rhythms are endogenously generated and self-sustaining and are relatively constant over a range of ambient temperatures. Important features include two interacting transcription-translation feedback loops: proteins containing PAS domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions; and several photoreceptors that fine-tune the clock to different light conditions. Anticipation of changes in the environment allows appropriate changes in a plant's physiological state, conferring an adaptive advantage. A better understanding of plant circadian rhythms has applications in agriculture, such as helping farmers stagger crop harvests to extend crop availability and securing against massive losses due to weather.	Plant circadian rhythms tell the plant what season it is and when to flower for the best chance of attracting pollinators. Behaviors showing rhythms include leaf movement, growth, germination, stomatal/gas exchange, and gene expression. These rhythms are controlled by an internal biological clock, which is synchronized with external cues such as light and temperature. The clock is composed of a network of genes and proteins that interact in a complex feedback loop. Disruption of circadian rhythms can have serious consequences for plant growth and development, as well as for the ecosystem as a whole, by affecting the timing of pollination and seed dispersal. Understanding the mechanisms underlying plant circadian rhythms is therefore crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change and other environmental stressors on plant communities.

While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.	Germany has a comprehensive school known as the Gesamtschule. While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have any such requirements. The Gesamtschule is a type of school that caters to students with varying academic abilities and backgrounds, and provides them with an equal opportunity for education. This school system aims to promote social integration and reduce educational inequality by offering a broad curriculum and flexible educational pathways. In addition, the Gesamtschule promotes the development of students' individual strengths and talents through its inclusive and cooperative learning environment. Overall, the Gesamtschule represents a unique approach to education that prioritizes equal access and opportunity for all students.

Parapodia are unjointed paired extensions of the body wall, and their muscles are derived from the circular muscles of the body. They are often supported internally by one or more large, thick chetae. The parapodia of burrowing and tube-dwelling polychaetes are often just ridges whose tips bear hooked chetae. In active crawlers and swimmers the parapodia are often divided into large upper and lower paddles on a very short trunk, and the paddles are generally fringed with chetae and sometimes with cirri (fused bundles of cilia) and gills.	Nearly all polychaetes have parapodia that function as limbs, while other major annelid groups lack them. Parapodia are unjointed paired extensions of the body wall, and their muscles are derived from the mesoderm. These structures enable polychaetes to move with greater agility and flexibility than other annelids, as well as providing a means of respiratory exchange and sensory input. The parapodia of polychaetes are also often armed with bristles, hooks, or other appendages that can be used for defense or to capture prey. The evolution of parapodia in the polychaete lineage has been linked to their success in adapting to a variety of marine environments, from shallow intertidal zones to deep sea trenches. Despite their importance, the exact developmental mechanisms and genetic pathways involved in parapodial development are still not fully understood.

Those that have long-distance migrants in the same family, such as the common chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita, are species of southern hemisphere origins that have progressively shortened their return migration to stay in the northern hemisphere.	Short-distance passerine migrants have two evolutionary origins. Those that have long-distance migrants in the same family, such as the common chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita, are species of southern hemisphere origins that have adapted to shorter migratory distances. On the other hand, some short-distance migrants, such as the European robin Erithacus rubecula, are species that have always been restricted to their current geographic range and have developed short-distance migration as a strategy to cope with seasonal changes in their environment. These two origins have resulted in different patterns of migration behavior and physiology, highlighting the importance of understanding the evolutionary history of migratory species.

However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these ""omega"" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids."	Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are considered essential: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). These essential fatty acids cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through the diet. They play important roles in the body, including maintaining healthy skin and hair, supporting immune function, and aiding in the production of hormones. A deficiency in essential fatty acids can lead to a range of health issues, including inflammation, impaired wound healing, and impaired cognitive function.

During this period, temperatures are in the mid 80s to low 90s (29–35 °C), accompanied by high humidity, though the heat is often relieved by afternoon thunderstorms or a sea breeze that develops off the Atlantic Ocean, which then allow lower temperatures, but conditions still remain very muggy. Much of the year's 55.9 inches (1,420 mm) of rainfall occurs during this period. Dewpoints in the warm months range from 71.9 °F (22.2 °C) in June to 73.7 °F (23.2 °C) in August.	The wet season begins some time in May, ending in mid-October. During this period, temperatures are in the mid 80s to low 90s (29–35 °C), accompanied by high humidity, though the amount of rainfall varies depending on the location. In some areas, such as the Amazon rainforest, the wet season brings heavy rains and flooding, while in other areas, such as the highlands, it may only bring light showers. Despite the challenges posed by the wet season, it is a crucial time for agriculture and natural ecosystems, as it replenishes water sources and supports the growth and reproduction of many plant and animal species. In addition, the wet season also plays a significant role in shaping cultural traditions and activities, such as religious ceremonies and festivals.

The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US. This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyoncé received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album's unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as ""bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood"". The single ""Drunk in Love"", featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, after much speculation in the weeks before, Beyoncé and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour. It served as the couple's first co-headlining stadium tour together. On August 24, 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Knowles also took home three competitive awards: Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for ""Pretty Hurts"", as well as best collaboration for ""Drunk in Love"". In November, Forbes reported that Beyoncé was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row—earning $115 million in the year, more than double her earnings in 2013. Beyoncé was reissued with new material in three forms: as an extended play, a box set, as well as a full platinum edition."

The three brothers—Rurik, Sineus, and Truvor—established themselves in Novgorod, Beloozero, and Izborsk, respectively. Two of the brothers died, and Rurik became the sole ruler of the territory and progenitor of the Rurik dynasty. The establishment of this dynasty marked the beginning of the Kievan Rus, a powerful medieval state comprising the territories of modern-day Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The Rurik dynasty ruled over the Kievan Rus for over 700 years, until the end of the 16th century. During their reign, the Kievan Rus experienced significant cultural and economic growth, and established strong political ties with neighboring states. Despite its eventual decline, the Kievan Rus remains an important historical and cultural symbol of the Eastern Slavic peoples.

Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices;	After the consulship had been opened to the plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the dictatorship and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse between the end of his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.	After the consulship had been opened to the plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the dictatorship and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; these limits ensured that no one could hold the same office twice or hold two offices at the same time. This system of checks and balances served to prevent any one individual from gaining too much power and thereby threatening the stability of the Roman Republic. The plebeians were thus able to contribute to the governance of Rome and to ensure that their interests were represented in the political sphere. This inclusive approach to governance helped to strengthen the Republic and ensured that it remained a stable and prosperous society for centuries to come.

After the demise of the Turkish Seljuk Sultanate of Rum in the 14th century, Anatolia was divided into a patchwork of independent, mostly Turkish states, the so-called Ghazi emirates. One of the emirates was led by Osman I (1258–1326), from whom the name Ottoman is derived. Osman I extended the frontiers of Turkish settlement toward the edge of the Byzantine Empire. It is not well understood how the early Ottomans came to dominate their neighbours, as the history of medieval Anatolia is still little known.	Ertuğrul, the father of Osman I (founder of the Ottoman Empire), arrived in Anatolia from Merv (Turkmenistan) with 400 horsemen to aid the Seljuks of Rum against the Byzantines. After settling in the region, Ertuğrul and his tribe became vassals of the Seljuks and were granted land in Söğüt, where they established a small principality. Under the leadership of Osman I, this principality grew in size and power, eventually forming the Ottoman Empire. The early Ottomans were known for their military prowess and strategic alliances, which allowed them to expand their territory and influence throughout the Middle East and Europe. Despite facing numerous challenges over the centuries, the Ottoman Empire endured for more than six hundred years, leaving a lasting impact on the history and culture of the region.

It is the biggest single segment of Micronesia, the largest islands between the island of Kyushu (Japan), New Guinea, the Philippines, and the Hawaiian Islands.	Despite Magellan's visit, Guam was not officially claimed by Spain until January 26, 1565 by General Miguel López de Legazpi.:46 From 1565 to 1815, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, which include Saipan and Tinian, were under the jurisdiction of the Spanish colonial government in the Philippines. During this period, Guam became an important stopover point for Spanish galleons traveling between Manila and Acapulco, and the island was used as a strategic military outpost due to its location in the western Pacific Ocean. Despite being colonized by Spain for over 250 years, the indigenous Chamorro people managed to maintain their distinct culture and language, which still exists today. In 1898, Guam was ceded to the United States as a result of the Spanish-American War, and it has remained a U.S. territory ever since.

U.S. forces continued in combat zone deployments through November 1995 and launched Operation Desert Fox against Iraq in 1998 after it failed to meet U.S. demands of ""unconditional cooperation"" in weapons inspections."	Following the ceasefire agreement that suspended hostilities (but not officially ended) in the 1991 Gulf War, the United States and its allies instituted and began patrolling Iraqi no-fly zones, to prevent Iraqi military aircraft and missiles from threatening or attacking neighboring countries. These no-fly zones were established in the north and south of Iraq, and were enforced through regular military patrols and, occasionally, the use of force. The rationale behind the establishment of these zones was to protect neighboring countries from potential Iraqi military aggression, and to facilitate the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people. However, the legality and effectiveness of these no-fly zones have been subjects of debate and controversy, with some critics arguing that they constitute a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and have resulted in civilian casualties.

Freedom of the press is ostensibly officially guaranteed by the government, but independent press outlets remain restricted, as does a substantial amount of web content. According to the Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety, in 2020, Azerbaijan ranked 168th out of 180 countries in terms of press freedom. The government has been known to use legal and extralegal measures to silence critical journalists, including arbitrary arrests, physical violence, and defamation lawsuits. Moreover, state-controlled media dominate the news landscape, disseminating pro-government propaganda and censoring any dissenting voices. These restrictions on press freedom undermine the public's access to accurate and diverse information, hindering the country's democratic development and violating its citizens' human rights.

In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers	Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A that is responsible for much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defense against eye infections.	Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan and an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides. This fundamental difference in cell wall structure is responsible for the differential staining properties observed between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria appear purple under the microscope, whereas gram-negative bacteria appear red or pink. Moreover, the cell wall structure of gram-negative bacteria provides them with greater resistance to antibiotics and other external agents, making them more challenging to treat in clinical settings.

"Instead, the donated money was expended through ""counterfeit drugs, siphoning off of drugs to the black market, and payments to ghost employees"". Ultimately, there is a sufficient amount of money being donated to global health initiatives, yet the lack of accountability and transparency in the distribution process has hindered the effectiveness of these efforts. Without proper oversight and regulation, the potential benefits of these donations are being undermined by corruption and mismanagement. Therefore, it is crucial for international organizations and governments to prioritize and address these issues in order to ensure that donated funds are being used to their fullest potential in improving global health outcomes."

The term became useful in order to describe differences perceived between two of its founders Francis Bacon, described as empiricist, and René Descartes, who is described as a rationalist. Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza, in the next generation, are often also described as an empiricist and a rationalist respectively. John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume were the primary exponents of empiricism in the 18th century Enlightenment, with Locke being the person who is normally known as the founder of empiricism as such.	British empiricism, though it was not a term used at the time, derives from the 17th century period of early modern philosophy and modern science. The term became useful in retrospect as a way of describing the shared epistemological and methodological approach of British philosophers such as John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume. Empiricism emphasizes the role of sensory experience and observation in acquiring knowledge and understanding of the world, and this approach was central to the development of the scientific method. British empiricists argued that all knowledge is derived from experience, and that there are no innate ideas or concepts that are independent of sensory input. This perspective challenged traditional philosophical and theological views, and paved the way for the development of modern science and rationalism.

The madaris also resemble colleges, where people take evening classes and reside in dormitories. An important function of the madaris is to admit orphans and poor children in order to provide them with education and training. Madaris may enroll female students; however, they study separately from the men.[citation needed]	People of all ages attend, and many often move on to becoming imams.[citation needed] The certificate of an ʻālim, for example, requires approximately twelve years of study.[citation needed] A good Islamic education is highly valued among Muslims, as it not only provides knowledge of the Quran and Hadith, but also a deeper understanding of Islamic jurisprudence and theology. The curriculum typically includes Arabic language, Quranic studies, Hadith, Islamic law, and theology, among other subjects. Islamic education institutions range from traditional madrasas to modern universities, with some offering online courses as well. The pursuit of Islamic knowledge is considered a lifelong journey, and many scholars continue to study and teach throughout their lives.

Other models used the original Weston scale up until ca. 1955. The company continued to publish Weston film ratings after 1955, but while their recommended values often differed slightly from the ASA film speeds found on film boxes, these newer Weston values were based on the ASA system and had to be converted for use with older Weston meters by subtracting 1/3 exposure stop as per Weston's recommendation. Vice versa, ""old"" Weston film speed ratings could be converted into ""new"" Westons and the ASA scale by adding the same amount, that is, a film rating of 100 Weston (up to 1955) corresponded with 125 ASA (as per ASA PH2.5-1954 and before). This conversion was not necessary on Weston meters manufactured and Weston film ratings published since 1956 due to their inherent use of the ASA system; however the changes of the ASA PH2.5-1960 revision may be taken into account when comparing with newer ASA or ISO values."	The Weston Cadet (model 852 introduced in 1949), Direct Reading (model 853 introduced 1954) and Master III (models 737 and S141.3 introduced in 1956) were the first in their line of instruments to incorporate the latest technological advancements in the field of electrical measurement. These instruments were designed to provide high accuracy, reliability, and ease of use to the technicians and engineers who relied on them for precision measurements. The Weston Cadet, Direct Reading, and Master III models were equipped with advanced features such as digital displays, automatic ranging, and self-calibration, which distinguished them from their predecessors. The introduction of these models marked a significant milestone in the history of electrical measurement, as they set a new standard for the performance and functionality of measuring instruments.

For example,	"An important part of traditional, pre-generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language; these units are known as phonemes. For example, in English, the ""p"" sound in pot is aspirated (pronounced [pʰ]) while that in spot is not aspirated (pronounced [p]). However, English speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations (allophones) of the same phonological category, that is of the phoneme /p/. (Traditionally, it would be argued that if an aspirated [pʰ] were interchanged with the unaspirated [p] in spot, native speakers of English would still hear the same words; that is, the two sounds are perceived as ""the same"" /p/.) In some other languages, however, these two sounds are perceived as different, and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes. For example, in Thai, Hindi, and Quechua, there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature (two words can have different meanings but with the only difference in pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one)."	"An important part of traditional, pre-generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language; these units are known as phonemes. For example, in English, the sounds /p/ and /b/ are considered to be distinct phonemes because they can change the meaning of a word when substituted for one another, as in ""pat"" and ""bat"". In contrast, the sounds /p/ and /h/ are not considered to be distinct phonemes in English because substituting one for the other does not change the meaning of a word. The study of phonemes is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of a language and for developing accurate phonemic transcriptions. Additionally, identifying phonemes can be useful for language learners who may struggle with producing or distinguishing between certain sounds."

In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults. Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South. The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings. Baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent."	"Historians trace the earliest church labeled ""Baptist"" back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor. In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected infant baptism and instead advocated for adult baptism by immersion. Smyth's beliefs and practices quickly spread to England and then to the American colonies, where the Baptist denomination became one of the most prominent and influential Protestant denominations. Today, Baptist churches can be found all over the world, with varying beliefs and practices depending on their specific interpretation of the Bible and their cultural context. Despite their diversity, however, all Baptist churches share a commitment to the importance of individual faith and personal conversion, as well as a belief in the authority of the Bible as the ultimate guide for Christian living."

Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.	The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages infiltrated into parts of Northern and Eastern Iran. As a result, Iranian languages became restricted to certain geographical areas, such as the central plateau of Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and parts of Pakistan. Despite this, Iranian languages have continued to evolve and adapt to changing linguistic and social environments. Today, they are spoken by millions of people in various parts of the world and serve as a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the Iranian people.

Despite Laemmle's role as an innovator, he was an extremely cautious studio chief. Unlike rivals Adolph Zukor, William Fox, and Marcus Loew, Laemmle chose not to develop a theater chain. He also financed all of his own films, refusing to take on debt. This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor-director Erich von Stroheim insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films Blind Husbands (1919) and Foolish Wives (1922), but Universal shrewdly gained a return on some of the expenditure by launching a sensational ad campaign that attracted moviegoers. Character actor Lon Chaney became a drawing card for Universal in the 1920s, appearing steadily in dramas. His two biggest hits for Universal were The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of the Opera (1925). During this period Laemmle entrusted most of the production policy decisions to Irving Thalberg. Thalberg had been Laemmle's personal secretary, and Laemmle was impressed by his cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated. Promoted to studio chief, Thalberg was giving Universal's product a touch of class, but MGM's head of production Louis B. Mayer lured Thalberg away from Universal with a promise of better pay. Without his guidance Universal became a second-tier studio, and would remain so for several decades.	Despite Laemmle's role as an innovator, he was an extremely cautious studio chief. Unlike rivals Adolph Zukor, William Fox, and Marcus Loew, Laemmle chose not to develop a theater chain. Instead, he focused on producing quality films and established Universal Pictures as a respected name in the industry. While this approach may have limited Universal's potential for financial gain, it allowed Laemmle to maintain creative control over his productions and prioritize artistic integrity over profit. Ultimately, Laemmle's dedication to quality filmmaking laid the foundation for Universal's continued success as a major Hollywood studio.

French historians usually place the period, called the Siècle des Lumières (Century of Enlightenments), between 1715 and 1789, from the beginning of the reign of Louis XV until the French Revolution. If taken back to the mid-17th century, the Enlightenment would trace its origins to Descartes' Discourse on Method, published in 1637. In France, many cited the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica in 1687. It is argued by several historians and philosophers that the beginning of the Enlightenment is when Descartes shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty by his cogito ergo sum published in 1637. As to its end, most scholars use the last years of the century, often choosing the French Revolution of 1789 or the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars (1804–15) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the Enlightenment.	There is little consensus on the precise beginning of the Age of Enlightenment; the beginning of the 18th century (1701) or the middle of the 17th century (1650) are often cited as possible starting points. However, it is generally agreed that the Age of Enlightenment was a period of intellectual and cultural transformation that swept through Europe during the 18th century. This period of philosophical and scientific inquiry was characterized by a renewed interest in reason, rationality, and empirical evidence, and it had a profound impact on everything from politics and economics to art and literature. The ideas and values of the Enlightenment continue to influence modern thought and society, shaping our understanding of democracy, individualism, and human rights.

"Bowers and Tanselle argue for rejecting textual variants that an author inserted at the suggestion of others. Bowers said that his edition of Stephen Crane's first novel, Maggie, presented ""the author's final intention,"" which means that only those variants that Crane himself made were included in the edition. Tanselle also contends that editors should respect an author's final intention and that the presence of variants that were not made by the author can introduce inconsistencies and errors into the text. Both Bowers and Tanselle emphasize the importance of preserving an author's original vision and artistic expression, and they believe that this can only be achieved by adhering strictly to the author's own revisions and corrections."

Tavern owners were required to possess a licence to sell ale, and a separate licence for distilled spirits.	There was already regulation on public drinking spaces in the 17th and 18th centuries,[citation needed] and the income earned from licences was beneficial to the crown. Tavern owners were required to obtain a licence from the local magistrate in order to operate their establishments, and failure to comply could result in fines or even closure. The regulation of public drinking spaces was seen as a way to maintain order and prevent excessive drunkenness, which was considered a threat to social stability. However, these regulations were often ineffective, and alcohol-related problems continued to be a major concern throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Despite this, the tradition of licensing and regulating public drinking spaces has persisted, with modern laws and regulations seeking to strike a balance between public safety and individual freedoms.

Cyprus has one of the warmest climates in the Mediterranean part of the European Union.[citation needed] The average annual temperature on the coast is around 24 °C (75 °F) during the day and 14 °C (57 °F) at night, making it an ideal destination for tourists seeking warm weather all year round. The country's location in the eastern Mediterranean region also means that it is subject to a mild and rainy winter period, which lasts from November to March. During this time, temperatures on the coast range between 16-18 °C (61-64 °F), providing a moderate climate for visitors who prefer cooler temperatures. In addition to its favorable climate, Cyprus boasts a rich cultural history and stunning natural landscapes, making it a popular tourist destination for travelers from all over the world.

Each arrondissement has	The mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters; the voters of each arrondissement elect the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement has a number of members depending upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 36 members for the most populated (the 15th). The elected council members select the mayor. Sometimes the candidate who receives the most votes city-wide is not selected if the other candidate has won the support of the majority of council members. Mayor Bertrand Delanoë (2001-2014) was elected by only a minority of city voters, but a majority of council members. Once elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government; it meets only once a month. The current council is divided between a coalition of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre right, plus a few members from smaller parties.	The mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters; the voters of each arrondissement elect the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement has its own mayor and council, who are responsible for local issues and services. The Conseil de Paris, in turn, elects the mayor of Paris from among its members. This system of indirect election is designed to ensure that the mayor has the support of a broad coalition of political parties and interests, and to prevent any one group from dominating the city's government. However, critics argue that the system can make it difficult for the mayor to implement a clear agenda or respond quickly to crises, as he or she must navigate the complex politics of the Conseil de Paris.
According to the American National Standards Institute, pitch is the auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high. Since pitch	"According to the American National Standards Institute, pitch is the auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high. Since pitch is such a close proxy for frequency, it is almost entirely determined by how quickly the sound wave is making the air vibrate and has almost nothing to do with the intensity, or amplitude, of the wave. That is, ""high"" pitch means very rapid oscillation, and ""low"" pitch corresponds to slower oscillation. Despite that, the idiom relating vertical height to sound pitch is shared by most languages. At least in English, it is just one of many deep conceptual metaphors that involve up/down. The exact etymological history of the musical sense of high and low pitch is still unclear. There is evidence that humans do actually perceive that the source of a sound is slightly higher or lower in vertical space when the sound frequency is increased or decreased."	According to the American National Standards Institute, pitch is the auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high. Since pitch is such an essential component of music and speech, it plays a critical role in our daily lives. The ability to recognize and produce different pitches is integral to singing, playing an instrument, and even communication. Pitch is determined by the frequency of sound waves, with higher frequencies associated with higher pitches and lower frequencies associated with lower pitches. The human ear can detect frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, although individual sensitivity can vary. Understanding pitch is crucial in fields such as music, linguistics, and audiology, where it is used to analyze and describe sound.

The area	The area receives about 820 millimetres (32.3 in) of annual rainfall, which is concentrated from June through September/October with little or no precipitation the remainder of the year. The area has two main seasons. The rainy season runs from June to October when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea. The dry season runs from November to May, when the air is relatively drier. This dry season subdivides into a cold period and a warm period. The cold period spans from November to February when polar air masses push down from the north and keep the air fairly dry. The warm period extends from March to May when tropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain.	The area receives about 820 millimetres (32.3 in) of annual rainfall, which is concentrated from June through September/October with little or no precipitation the remainder of the year. The area is known for its Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The dry summers are a result of the subtropical high pressure system that dominates the region during this season, while the wet winters are influenced by the passage of mid-latitude cyclones. These weather systems bring in moist air from the Atlantic Ocean, which results in the bulk of the area's annual rainfall. The concentration of rainfall during the summer months can lead to water scarcity issues during the rest of the year, which can have significant impacts on the local ecosystem and human populations.

He published his back-translation in a 1903 volume together with his English-language original, the French translation, and a ""Private History of the 'Jumping Frog' Story"". The latter included a synopsized adaptation of his story that Twain stated had appeared, unattributed to Twain, in a Professor Sidgwick’s Greek Prose Composition (p. 116) under the title, ""The Athenian and the Frog""; the adaptation had for a time been taken for an independent ancient Greek precursor to Twain's ""Jumping Frog"" story."	"Mark Twain provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a French translation of his short story, ""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County."" In his back-translation, Twain demonstrated that the French translator had misunderstood the humor and the dialect of the original story, resulting in a completely different tale altogether. This incident highlights the difficulties of accurately translating and conveying humor across different languages and cultures. It also underscores the importance of relying on professional translators who possess both linguistic and cultural expertise in order to avoid misinterpretations and inaccuracies in the translation process."

This statistic is often used in taxonomy to compare differences between any two given populations by measuring the genetic differences among and between populations for individual genes, or for many genes simultaneously. It is often stated that the fixation index for humans is about 0.15. This translates to an estimated 85% of the variation measured in the overall human population is found within individuals of the same population, and about 15% of the variation occurs between populations. These estimates imply that any two individuals from different populations are almost as likely to be more similar to each other than either is to a member of their own group. Richard Lewontin, who affirmed these ratios, thus concluded neither ""race"" nor ""subspecies"" were appropriate or useful ways to describe human populations. However, others have noticed that group variation was relatively similar to the variation observed in other mammalian species."	The population geneticist Sewall Wright developed one way of measuring genetic differences between populations known as the Fixation index, which is often abbreviated to FST. This statistic is often used to quantify the degree of genetic differentiation between populations, with values ranging from 0 (no differentiation) to 1 (complete differentiation). FST is calculated by comparing the genetic variation within populations to the genetic variation between populations, and can be used to infer the evolutionary history and relationships of different groups of organisms. In addition to its use in evolutionary biology, the FST statistic has also been applied in fields such as conservation biology and forensic genetics, where it can aid in identifying distinct populations and informing management strategies.

Despite the evolution of food trends and the rise of gastropubs, the humble pie and pint combination has endured as a comforting and traditional meal option for many pub-goers. It is often seen as a symbol of British working-class culture and has been celebrated in literature, music and film as a quintessential example of British cuisine. Overall, the enduring popularity of the pie and pint tradition highlights the importance of cultural heritage and the ways in which food can serve as a powerful marker of identity and community."

Schindler's List earned	Spielberg's next film, Schindler's List, was based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust. Schindler's List earned Spielberg his first Academy Award for Best Director (it also won Best Picture). With the film a huge success at the box office, Spielberg used the profits to set up the Shoah Foundation, a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors. In 1997, the American Film Institute listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made (#9) which moved up to (#8) when the list was remade in 2007.	Spielberg's next film, Schindler's List, was based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust. Schindler's List earned numerous awards and critical acclaim for its powerful portrayal of the atrocities committed during World War II. The film's cinematography, direction, and acting were widely praised, with Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler being particularly lauded. Beyond its artistic achievements, Schindler's List also sparked important conversations about the responsibility of individuals in the face of systemic oppression and the ongoing relevance of the Holocaust in modern society. To this day, it remains a seminal work in the canon of historical cinema.

Focused by the commitment to a Moon landing, in January 1962 the US announced Project Gemini, a two-man spacecraft that would support the later three-man Apollo by developing the key technologies and techniques necessary for space travel. Project Gemini was designed to test and evaluate systems for rendezvous and docking in space, long-duration flights, and extravehicular activity (EVA), among other things. Over the course of the program, ten manned missions were conducted, each contributing valuable data and insights into the challenges and opportunities of space travel. With the successful completion of Project Gemini, the US was able to move forward with confidence towards the ultimate goal of landing a man on the Moon.

Tito was just shy of his 59th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief Aleksandar Ranković as the best man. Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally. At that time, she was in her early 20s and Tito, objecting to her energetic personality, opted for the more mature opera singer Zinka Kunc instead. Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at Beli Dvor, where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance after Tito's strange relationship with Zinka failed. Since Jovanka was the only female companion he married while in power, she also went down in history as Yugoslavia's first lady. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'état by the latter pair. Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s, shortly before his death. However, during Tito's funeral she was officially present as his wife, and later claimed rights for inheritance. The couple did not have any children.	His best known wife was Jovanka Broz. Tito was just shy of his 59th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief Aleksandar Rankovic as Tito's best man. Jovanka Broz was a former partisan fighter and a member of the Communist Party. As Tito's wife, she played a significant role in the political and social life of Yugoslavia, representing the country on numerous foreign visits and attending state functions alongside her husband. However, their relationship was not without its difficulties, and rumors of infidelity and political disagreements plagued their marriage. After Tito's death in 1980, Jovanka Broz was placed under house arrest for several years before eventually being allowed to live in seclusion until her death in 2013.

Hunt Sahir Field in	Increasing state control over the oil sector, the RCC began a program of nationalization, starting with the expropriation of British Petroleum's share of the British Petroleum-N.B. Hunt Sahir Field in December 1971. In September 1973, it was announced that all foreign oil producers active in Libya were to be nationalized. For Gaddafi, this was an important step towards socialism. It proved an economic success; while gross domestic product had been $3.8 billion in 1969, it had risen to $13.7 billion in 1974, and $24.5 billion in 1979. In turn, the Libyans' standard of life greatly improved over the first decade of Gaddafi's administration, and by 1979 the average per-capita income was at $8,170, up from $40 in 1951; this was above the average of many industrialized countries like Italy and the U.K.	Increasing state control over the oil sector, the RCC began a program of nationalization, starting with the expropriation of British Petroleum's share of the British Petroleum-N.B. Hunt Sahir Field in 1975. The program continued with the nationalization of several other oil companies, including Exxon, Mobil, and Texaco, in 1976. This was a significant move towards economic independence for Iraq, as it allowed the government to take control of its natural resources and use the revenues for national development. However, this nationalization also led to a decline in foreign investment in the country, which had negative consequences for the economy in the long run. Despite the potential drawbacks, the nationalization of the oil sector was an essential step in Iraq's efforts to assert its sovereignty and gain greater control over its economic destiny.

Cities all	The depression had devastating effects in virtually every country, rich or poor. International trade plunged by half to two-thirds, as did personal income, tax revenue, prices and profits. Cities all around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60 percent. Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most.	The depression had devastating effects in virtually every country, rich or poor. International trade plunged by half to two-thirds, as did personal income, tax revenue, prices and profits. Cities all over the world experienced high unemployment rates and poverty, with many families struggling to make ends meet. In addition, the depression led to political instability and increased support for extremist political parties in many countries. The United States, which had previously been seen as a beacon of economic stability and prosperity, was also affected, with widespread unemployment and a sharp decline in industrial production. The global impact of the depression was felt for many years, and it took a concerted effort by governments and international organizations to rebuild the global economy and restore confidence in the financial system.

In the past, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have been replaced by Štokavian during the period of migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 15th and the 16th centuries. These migrations caused the koinéisation of the Shtokavian dialects, that used to form the West Shtokavian (more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects) and East Shtokavian (transitional towards the Torlakian and the whole Bulgaro-Macedonian area) dialect bundles, and their subsequent spread at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian. As a result, Štokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined, and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where non-literary dialects are still being spoken.	The Serbo-Croatian dialects differ not only in the question word they are named after, but also heavily in phonology, accentuation and intonation, case endings and tense system (morphology) and basic vocabulary. These variations are primarily due to historical and geographical factors that have led to the development of distinct dialects across the region. For instance, the dialects spoken in the northern parts of the former Yugoslavia have been influenced by the Hungarian and German languages, while those in the southern parts have been influenced by Italian and Turkish. Additionally, the dialects spoken in the coastal regions have been influenced by the languages of the Mediterranean, such as Greek and Venetian. Despite these differences, the Serbo-Croatian dialects are mutually intelligible, which allows speakers from different regions to communicate effectively.

More specifically, apparent rebounds of minority enrollment can be explained by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states, and the beneficiaries of class-based (not race) affirmative action would be white students. At the same time, affirmative action itself is both morally and materially costly: 52 percent of white populace (compared to 14 percent of black) thought it should be abolished, implying white distaste of using racial identity, and full-file review is expected to cost the universities an additional $1.5 million to $2 million per year, excluding possible cost of litigation.	A study in 2007 by Mark Long, an economics professor at the University of Washington, demonstrated that the alternatives of affirmative action proved ineffective in restoring minority enrollment in public universities. Long's research indicated that despite the implementation of policies such as race-neutral admissions and targeted outreach programs, minority enrollment rates remained stagnant. Furthermore, Long's findings revealed that while these alternative policies may have increased the overall number of applicants, they did not necessarily result in increased enrollment of underrepresented minority groups. Long suggests that the root cause of underrepresentation in higher education lies in the longstanding systemic barriers faced by minority communities, and that affirmative action remains a necessary tool in addressing these disparities.

However, the written script was and remains adapted to the literary form, which is based on classical Chinese, not the vernacular and spoken form. Furthermore, the character inventory used for Mandarin (standard written Chinese) does not correspond to Hokkien words, and there are a large number of informal characters (替字, thè-jī or thòe-jī; 'substitute characters') which are unique to Hokkien (as is the case with Cantonese). For instance, about 20 to 25% of Taiwanese morphemes lack an appropriate or standard Chinese character.	Hokkien dialects are typically written using Chinese characters (漢字, Hàn-jī). However, the written script was and remains adapted to the literary form, which is based on classical Chinese, not the spoken form of Hokkien. As a result, written Hokkien may not fully reflect the unique sounds and grammatical structures of the dialect. Additionally, the use of Chinese characters for Hokkien may pose challenges for those who are not familiar with the language, as the same characters may have different pronunciations and meanings in different dialects. Despite these limitations, the use of Chinese characters has played an important role in preserving the written tradition of Hokkien, which has a rich history dating back centuries.

Along with the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University and Drexel University make up the city's major research universities. The city is also home to five schools of medicine: Drexel University College of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, and the Thomas Jefferson University. Hospitals, universities, and higher education research institutions in Philadelphia's four congressional districts received more than $252 million in National Institutes of Health grants in 2015.	The city's largest private school by number of students is Temple University, followed by Drexel University. Along with the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University and Drexel University make up the majority of the higher education institutions in Philadelphia. These universities have a significant impact on the city's economy, both through the employment opportunities they provide and the spending power of their students. Additionally, these institutions play a vital role in shaping the city's cultural landscape, as they host a variety of events and performances that are open to the public. Despite their contributions to the city, these universities also face challenges related to affordability and accessibility, particularly for low-income students.

An elevator is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a ""cage"", ""carriage"" or ""car"") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a ""hoistway"". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a ""traction"" elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved pulley, commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a counterweight. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight."	Some people argue that elevators began as simple rope or chain hoists (see Traction elevators below). An elevator is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical system. While the basic concept of elevators has remained the same, their design and technology have significantly evolved over time. Today, elevators are equipped with advanced safety features, efficient power systems, and sophisticated control mechanisms. Additionally, elevators are now capable of transporting people and goods vertically at much higher speeds and to much greater heights than ever before. As a result, elevators have become an integral part of modern infrastructure, enabling people to travel seamlessly from one level to another in buildings of all shapes and sizes.

It became known as the servicemen's playground, as it was where sailors from the Royal Navy would seek entertainment of all kinds. During the 1930s, there were 30 pubs and it attracted such performers as Charlie Chaplin to the New Palace Theatre. It is now the late-night hub of Plymouth's entertainment strip, but has a reputation for trouble at closing hours.	Built in 1815, Union Street was at the heart of Plymouth's historical culture. It became known as the servicemen's playground, as it was where sailors from the Royal Navy would often spend their free time, enjoying the various pubs, restaurants, and entertainment venues that lined the street. In the 19th century, it was also a hub for the city's bustling commercial trade, with shops selling everything from textiles to spices. Today, Union Street remains a vibrant and bustling part of Plymouth's city center, attracting both locals and visitors alike with its rich history and lively atmosphere. Despite undergoing significant changes over the years, it still retains much of its original charm and character, making it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in exploring Plymouth's past and present.

His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.	Seattle was also the home base of impresario Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies. His activities were instrumental in establishing Seattle as a center for popular entertainment, with Pantages' theaters drawing large crowds and providing a platform for local performers to showcase their talents. However, Pantages' legacy is also marred by controversy, as he was accused of rape in 1929 and subsequently convicted, leading to a tarnishing of his reputation and a decline in his business ventures. Nonetheless, his impact on the entertainment industry in Seattle and beyond is undeniable, and his theaters remain an important part of the city's cultural history.

The Phayap Army sent troops to invade and occupy northeastern Burma, which was former Thai territory that had been annexed by Britain much earlier. Also involved were the Japanese puppet states of Manchukuo and Mengjiang (consisting of most of Manchuria and parts of Inner Mongolia respectively), and the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime (which controlled the coastal regions of China).	The Axis states which assisted Japan included the authoritarian government of Thailand in World War II, which quickly formed a temporary alliance with the Japanese in 1941, as the Japanese invaded Thailand and demanded access to its territory. Thailand, under the leadership of Prime Minister Phibun Songkhram, saw the alliance with Japan as an opportunity to regain the territories it had lost to the French and British in the past. The Thai government provided the Japanese with troops, resources, and transportation to support their war efforts in Southeast Asia. Thailand's participation in the Axis powers was significant, as it provided Japan with a valuable ally in the region and allowed for the expansion of its empire. However, this alliance also resulted in Thailand's eventual defeat and occupation by the Allied powers at the end of World War II.

An alp refers to a high mountain pasture where cows are taken to be grazed during the summer months and where hay barns can be found, and the term ""the Alps"", referring to the mountains, is a misnomer. The term for the mountain peaks varies by nation and language: words such as horn, kogel, gipfel, spitz, and berg are used in German speaking regions: mont, pic, dent and aiguille in French speaking regions; and monte, picco or cima in Italian speaking regions."	In modern languages the term alp, alm, albe or alpe refers to a grazing pastures in the alpine regions below the glaciers, not the peaks. An alp refers to a high-altitude meadow or pasture, typically located in the mountainous regions of Europe. These areas are characterized by their rugged terrain and harsh climatic conditions, which make them unsuitable for traditional agriculture. Instead, alps are used for grazing livestock, particularly cows, which are raised for their milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Historically, alps were an important part of the rural economy in many alpine communities, providing a valuable source of income for farmers and their families. Today, some alps have been preserved as cultural heritage sites, while others have been transformed into tourist attractions, offering visitors a unique glimpse into the traditional way of life in the Alps.

"Canonical jurisprudential theory generally follows the principles of Aristotelian-Thomistic legal philosophy. While the term ""law"" is never explicitly defined in the Code, the Catechism of the Catholic Church cites Aquinas and his belief that law is an ordinance of reason for the common good, promulgated by one who has care of the community. This understanding of law emphasizes the importance of reason and morality in the creation and enforcement of laws. Furthermore, canonical jurisprudence places great emphasis on the role of the Church as the interpreter and enforcer of divine law, which is seen as the ultimate source of all legal authority. This approach to law and its relationship to morality and religion has been influential in shaping the Catholic Church's stance on a wide range of issues, including marriage, sexuality, and social justice."

The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern oaks, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.	If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of soil and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually slow down as it reaches maturity. However, if the tree grows in a crowded forest, competition for resources such as light, water, and nutrients will cause the tree to grow slower and reach maturity at a later age. In addition, environmental factors such as drought or extreme weather events can also impact the tree's growth rate and lifespan. Ultimately, the growth and development of a tree is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and ecological factors.

John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms and sponsored discussions in Oxford between his agents and the rebels during the spring. John appears to have been playing for time until Pope Innocent III could send letters giving him explicit papal support. This was particularly important for John, as a way of pressuring the barons but also as a way of controlling Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the meantime, John began to recruit fresh mercenary forces from Poitou, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the king was escalating the conflict. John announced his intent to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law.	Within a few months of John's return, rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule. John held a council in London in January 1215 to address the situation, but his efforts were largely unsuccessful. The barons, led by Robert Fitzwalter, demanded that John agree to a charter of liberties that would limit the king's power and protect the rights of free men. This charter, known as Magna Carta, was signed by John at Runnymede in June 1215. It is considered a landmark in the history of English law and government, as it established the principle that even the king was subject to the law. Despite its significance, however, Magna Carta did not bring an end to the conflict between John and the rebel barons. The civil war continued until John's death in 1216, and the charter itself would be revised and reissued several times over the centuries.

See for example careers of Senator Adam Kisiel and Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki.	The Orthodox nobles' rights were nominally equal to those enjoyed by Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but there was a cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism, that was greatly eased in the 16th century. While the Orthodox nobles were allowed to hold positions of power and own land, they faced discrimination in terms of access to education and employment opportunities. Despite their legal equality, the Orthodox nobles often found themselves marginalized in the political sphere and were excluded from the privileges that the Catholic nobility enjoyed. This unequal treatment was a result of the deeply ingrained religious divisions between the Orthodox and Catholic communities in Poland-Lithuania. However, the easing of cultural pressures to convert to Catholicism in the 16th century marked a significant step towards greater religious tolerance and inclusivity in the region.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Professors S. Pacala and Robert H. Socolow have developed a series of ""stabilization wedges"" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and ""renewable energy sources,"" in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their ""wedges."""	The incentive to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic reasons. The burning of fossil fuels for energy production is a major contributor to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which in turn is causing climate change. The use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate the effects of climate change. Additionally, renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels, making them an attractive option for businesses and governments alike. As such, the transition to 100% renewable energy has become a key goal for many countries and organizations around the world.

Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for ""extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated"" and coining the term ""Darwinism"" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies."	Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin 's theory of evolution, recognizing its potential to revolutionize not only biology but also other fields. Huxley's interest in evolution eventually led him to explore the relationship between structure and function in the animal kingdom, an approach that became known as comparative anatomy. Through his studies, Huxley demonstrated the evolutionary connections between different species, leading to a better understanding of the diversity of life on earth. His contributions to the field of comparative anatomy paved the way for future discoveries in biology and evolution, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary research in advancing scientific knowledge.

The track's minimalist approach, characterized by its sparse percussion and hypnotic synthesizer melodies, was a departure from the more traditional house and disco sounds that were popular at the time. ""Nude Photo"" would go on to become a seminal track in the development of techno, influencing countless producers and helping to establish Detroit as a hub for electronic music innovation. Its impact can still be heard in contemporary techno and house music, making it a testament to the enduring power of innovative and boundary-pushing music."

Also, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa, an unorganized, unincorporated territory, could both attempt to gain statehood. Some proposals call for the Virgin Islands to be admitted with Puerto Rico as one state (often known as the proposed ""Commonwealth of Prusvi"", for Puerto Rico/U.S. Virgin Islands, or as ""Puerto Virgo""), and for the amalgamation of U.S. territories or former territories in the Pacific Ocean, in the manner of the ""Greater Hawaii"" concept of the 1960s. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands would be admitted as one state, along with Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands (although these latter three entities are now separate sovereign nations, which have Compact of Free Association relationships with the United States). Such a state would have a population of 412,381 (slightly lower than Wyoming's population) and a land area of 911.82 square miles (2,361.6 km2) (slightly smaller than Rhode Island). American Samoa could possibly be part of such a state, increasing the population to 467,900 and the area to 988.65 square miles (2,560.6 km2). Radio Australia, in late May 2008, issued signs of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands becoming one again and becoming the 51st state."	Other less likely contenders are Guam and the United States Virgin Islands, both of which are unincorporated organized territories of the United States. Also, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa, which are also unincorporated territories of the United States, have been suggested as possible candidates for statehood. However, these territories have small populations and may not meet the necessary requirements for statehood, such as a viable economy and a strong political infrastructure. Additionally, there may be resistance from the residents of these territories who may prefer their current status as territories rather than becoming a state. Therefore, while these territories cannot be completely ruled out as potential candidates for statehood, they are less likely to become states in the near future.

The League tried to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. The Abyssinian war showed Hitler how weak the League was and encouraged the remilitarization of the Rhineland in flagrant disregard of the Treaty of Versailles. This was the first in a series of provocative acts culminating in the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War.	A series of international crises strained the League to its limits, the earliest being the invasion of Manchuria by Japan and the Abyssinian crisis of 1935/36 in which Italy invaded Ethiopia. Despite the League's efforts to resolve these conflicts through diplomacy and economic sanctions, they ultimately failed to prevent the aggressors from achieving their goals. The League's inability to enforce its decisions and maintain international peace and security led to a loss of credibility and support, and ultimately contributed to its collapse in the lead-up to World War II. The failures of the League highlighted the need for a stronger and more effective international organization, which led to the creation of the United Nations after the war.

Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.	Bird migration is the regular seasonal movement, often north and south along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation , energy expenditure, and exposure to a range of environmental hazards. Nevertheless, birds have evolved various adaptations to aid their migration, such as increased fat reserves, enlarged heart and lungs, and navigational abilities. While the exact mechanisms of bird migration are still not fully understood, it is clear that it is a vital process for many species, as it allows them to access resources and habitats that would otherwise be unavailable. Human activities, including habitat destruction and climate change, have also had significant impacts on bird migration patterns and populations, highlighting the need for ongoing research and conservation efforts.

The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva. The later Puritan movement, often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists, eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations.	The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age. The early Puritan movement was a reaction to the perceived religious compromises of the English Reformation, which they believed had not gone far enough in purging Catholic practices from the Church of England. This led to increasingly strident demands for further reforms, including the removal of vestments, the abolition of the sign of the cross in baptism, and the rejection of the episcopal system of church government. However, these demands were strongly opposed by Queen Elizabeth and her supporters, who saw them as a threat to the stability of the Church and the state. Despite this opposition, the Puritan movement continued to grow, eventually leading to the establishment of a separate Puritan Church in the 17th century.

Mercury was increasingly ill and could barely walk when the band recorded ""The Show Must Go On"" in 1990. Because of this, May had concerns about whether he was physically capable of singing it. Recalling Mercury's successful performance May states; ""he went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal"". The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come in to the studio, for an hour or two at a time. May says of Mercury: “He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.’ He had no fear, really.” The band's second greatest hits compilation, Greatest Hits II, followed in October 1991, which is the eighth best-selling album of all time in the UK and has sold 16 million copies worldwide."	"Innuendo was released in early 1991 with an eponymous number 1 UK hit and other charting singles including, ""The Show Must Go On"". Mercury was increasingly ill and could barely perform during this time, but he managed to record the vocals for the album using a stool to prop himself up in the recording booth. Despite the physical limitations he faced, Mercury's vocal performance on Innuendo was regarded as one of his best, showcasing his range and emotional depth. The album was a critical and commercial success, receiving positive reviews and selling over 1 million copies in the UK alone. It remains a testament to Mercury's talent and perseverance, as well as a beloved work in the Queen discography."

Certainly from then on, but likely earlier, the Roman and Greek cultures were virtually fused into a single Greco-Roman world. Although the Latin West recognized the Eastern Empire's claim to the Roman legacy for several centuries, after Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne, king of the Franks, as the ""Roman Emperor"" on 25 December 800, an act which eventually led to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire, the Latin West started to favour the Franks and began to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire largely as the Empire of the Greeks (Imperium Graecorum)."	The Eastern Roman Empire – today conventionally named the Byzantine Empire, a name not in use during its own time – became increasingly influenced by Greek culture after the 7th century. The Byzantine Empire was a continuation of the Roman Empire in the east, and its society and language were initially Latin-based. However, with the rise of Greek influence, the Eastern Roman Empire gradually shifted towards a more Greek-oriented culture. Greek became the language of the elite, and Greek literature, philosophy, and art became the dominant cultural forms. This Greek influence is evident in many aspects of Byzantine society, from its architecture to its religious practices. The Byzantine Empire's adoption of Greek culture was a significant development in the history of the Eastern Mediterranean, and it had a profound impact on the shaping of the region's cultural identity.

The Fraunhofer Gesellschaft owns many of the basic patents underlying these formats as well, with others held by Dolby Labs, Sony, Thomson Consumer Electronics, and AT&T.	Other lossy formats exist. Among these, mp3PRO, AAC, and MP2 are all members of the same technological family as MP3 and depend on roughly similar psychoacoustic models. The Fraunhofer Gesellschaft developed mp3PRO as an extension of the original MP3 format, allowing for higher compression rates without sacrificing quality. AAC, on the other hand, was developed by Dolby Laboratories as a successor to MP3, offering even better compression and sound quality. MP2, while not as popular as MP3, is still used for broadcasting and digital television applications. Despite their differences, all of these lossy formats rely on the same basic principles of compression and psychoacoustic modeling to create smaller, more manageable files that still retain a high level of sound quality.

During the Low Middle Ages it saw a golden age as the literary and dominant language of the Crown of Aragon, and was widely used all over the Mediterranean. The union of Aragon with the other territories of Spain in 1479 marked the start of the decline of the language. In 1659 Spain ceded Northern Catalonia to France, and Catalan was banned in both states in the early 18th century. 19th-century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival, which culminated in the 1913 orthographic standardization, and the officialization of the language during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39). However, the Francoist dictatorship (1939–75) banned the language again.	Catalan evolved from Vulgar Latin around the eastern Pyrenees in the 9th century. During the Low Middle Ages it saw a golden age as the literary and dominant language of the Crown of Aragon, which included Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands. However, in the 16th century, political and social changes led to the marginalization of Catalan, as the Spanish monarchy sought to unify the country under a single language and culture. Despite this, Catalan persisted and experienced a revival in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially during the Catalan Renaissance and the cultural and political movements of the 20th century. Today, Catalan is spoken by over 10 million people worldwide and is an official language in Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands, as well as the co-official language in the eastern region of Aragon and the country of Andorra.

It was the first time that the Olympic torch had traveled to Macau. A ceremony was held at Macau Fisherman's Wharf. Afterward, the torch traveled through Macau, passing by a number of landmarks including A-Ma Temple, Macau Tower, Ponte Governador Nobre de Carvalho, Ponte de Sai Van, Macau Cultural Centre, Macau Stadium and then back to the Fisherman's Wharf for the closing ceremony. Parts of the route near Ruins of St. Paul's and Taipa was shortened due to large crowds of supporters blocking narrow streets. A total of 120 torchbearers participated in this event including casino tycoon Stanley Ho. Leong Hong Man and Leong Heng Teng were the first and last torchbearer in the relay respectively. An article published on Macao Daily News criticized that the list of the torchbearers could not fully represent the Macanese and that there were too many non-athletes among the torchbearers. (some of whom had already been torchbearers of other sporting events)	Macao: The event was held in Macau on May 3. It was the first time that the Olympic torch had traveled to Macau. A ceremony was held at Macau Fisherman's Wharf to welcome the torch, which was carried by a group of local torchbearers. The event was attended by a large crowd of spectators who lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the torch and cheer on the runners. The torch relay in Macau was a significant moment for the city, as it showcased its ability to host major international events and raised its profile on the global stage. The event also highlighted the importance of sports and the Olympic Games in promoting cultural exchange and unity among nations. Overall, the Olympic torch relay in Macau was a memorable and historic occasion that brought together people from all walks of life to celebrate the values of the Olympic movement.

Whereas in 1992 Russia accounted for 92% of Estonia's international trade, today there is extensive economic interdependence between Estonia and its Nordic neighbours: three quarters of foreign investment in Estonia originates in the Nordic countries (principally Finland and Sweden), to which Estonia sends 42% of its exports (as compared to 6.5% going to Russia, 8.8% to Latvia, and 4.7% to Lithuania). On the other hand, the Estonian political system, its flat rate of income tax, and its non-welfare-state model distinguish it from the Nordic countries and their Nordic model, and indeed from many other European countries.	In 2005, Estonia joined the European Union's Nordic Battle Group. It has also shown continued interest in joining the Nordic Council. Whereas in 1992 Russia accounted for 92% of Estonia's foreign trade, by 2019 this had dropped to 9%. This shift in Estonia's foreign relations is reflective of its desire to align itself more closely with Western Europe and distance itself from its former Soviet occupier. Joining the Nordic Battle Group and expressing interest in joining the Nordic Council are just two examples of Estonia's efforts to integrate into the Western political and economic sphere. This shift in foreign relations has had a significant impact on Estonia's economy, as it has opened up new markets and diversified its trade partners.

The intellectual transformation of the Renaissance is viewed	After the end of the late Middle Ages period, the Renaissance would spread unevenly over continental Europe from the southern European region. The intellectual transformation of the Renaissance is viewed as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era. Europeans would later begin an era of world discovery. Combined with the influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning. These two things would lead to the Protestant Reformation. Europeans also discovered new trading routes, as was the case with Columbus’s travel to the Americas in 1492, and Vasco da Gama’s circumnavigation of Africa and India in 1498. Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations.	After the end of the late Middle Ages period, the Renaissance would spread unevenly over continental Europe from the southern European region. The intellectual transformation of the Renaissance is viewed as a rebirth of classical learning and a revival of interest in the human experience, which led to new developments in art, literature, philosophy, and science. The Renaissance represented a significant change in the way people viewed the world, and it had a profound impact on the subsequent course of Western civilization. However, the spread of the Renaissance was not uniform, and different regions of Europe experienced it to varying degrees and at different times. Nonetheless, the Renaissance remains a crucial period in the history of Europe, and its legacy continues to shape our modern society in many ways.

In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension to be applied to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.	A common application of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of a torque motor are ideal for ensuring a constant and controlled tension on the tape as it is wound and unwound. The torque motor's ability to provide high torque at low speeds allows for precise and smooth control of the tape motion. Additionally, the torque motor's lack of brushes or commutators results in a long lifespan and low maintenance requirements. Overall, the use of torque motors in tape drives ensures reliable and consistent performance, making them a popular choice in the industry.

At war's end, American, British, and Soviet scientific intelligence teams competed to capture Germany's rocket engineers along with the German rockets themselves and the designs on which they were based. Each of the Allies captured a share of the available members of the German rocket team, but the United States benefited the most with Operation Paperclip, recruiting von Braun and most of his engineering team, who later helped develop the American missile and space exploration programs. The United States also acquired a large number of complete V2 rockets.	At war's end, American, British, and Soviet scientific intelligence teams competed to capture Germany's rocket engineers along with the German rockets themselves and the designs on which they were based. This race to secure German rocket technology was fueled by the desire to gain a strategic advantage in the Cold War. The United States ultimately emerged as the victor in this competition, securing the services of Wernher von Braun, the mastermind behind the German V-2 rocket program. With von Braun's expertise, the US was able to develop the Saturn V rocket, which propelled NASA's Apollo missions to the moon. The capture and exploitation of German rocket technology had a profound impact on the course of space exploration and technology development in the decades that followed.

In 1952, Thomas Watson, Sr., stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm; his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., was named president. In 1956, the company demonstrated the first hard disk drive, which revolutionized computer storage by allowing for vast amounts of data to be stored in a small space. This innovation paved the way for the development of modern computers and contributed to the information age. Additionally, during Watson Jr.'s tenure, IBM became a major player in the space race, providing technology and support to NASA for the Apollo missions. Under his leadership, IBM also expanded its global reach, establishing offices and manufacturing facilities around the world. Watson Jr.'s contributions to IBM and the technology industry have had a lasting impact that can still be felt today.

"In 1422 King Władysław II Jagiełło by the Privilege of Czerwińsk (Polish: ""przywilej czerwiński"") established the inviolability of nobles' property (their estates could not be confiscated except upon a court order), and granted them the right to appeal against the King's decisions to a sejm (Polish parliament) composed of nobles. This marked a significant shift towards a more democratic system of governance in Poland, as it gave the nobility a greater say in the affairs of the country. However, it also entrenched the power of the nobility, who became increasingly resistant to any attempts to limit their privileges or share power with other social groups. This ultimately led to the downfall of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century, as the nobility proved unable to adapt to the changing political and economic realities of the time."

There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees, and about 150,000 recently arrived Iraqi refugees, but the number of the largest group, the Sudanese, is contested.[nb 1] The once-vibrant and ancient Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt have almost disappeared, with only a small number remaining in the country, but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious or other occasions and tourism. Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.	Egypt also hosts an unknown number of refugees and asylum seekers, estimated to be between 500,000 and 3 million. There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees, and about 150,000 recently arrived refugees and asylum seekers from Syria. However, due to Egypt's lack of a comprehensive legal framework for refugees, many of them face significant challenges in accessing basic services such as education, healthcare, and employment. Moreover, the Egyptian government has been criticized for its treatment of refugees, including reports of arbitrary detention, forced deportation, and violence. As a result, Egypt's refugee population remains vulnerable and marginalized, highlighting the urgent need for legal protections and support.

""When looking at images of the Egyptian goddess Isis and those of the Virgin Mary, one may initially observe iconographic similarities. These parallels have led many scholars to suggest that there is a distinct iconographic relationship between Isis and Mary.

"	"The adoption of the mother of Jesus as a virtual goddess may represent a reintroduction of aspects of the worship of Isis. ""When looking at images of the Egyptian goddess Isis and those of the Virgin Mary, there are striking similarities in their depictions as nurturing, maternal figures,"" (Patterson, 2008). However, it is important to note that the veneration of Mary in Christianity differs significantly from the worship of Isis in ancient Egyptian religion. While Isis was worshipped as a deity with her own cult following, Mary is primarily venerated as a saint and a human mother who played a pivotal role in the birth of Jesus. Nonetheless, the parallels between the two figures highlight the ways in which religious traditions can influence and borrow from one another over time."

"Bermuda's national cricket team participated in the Cricket World Cup 2007 in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a 130 kilograms (290 lb) police officer named Dwayne Leverock. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a One-Day International (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well-known is David Hemp, a former captain of Glamorgan in English first class cricket. The annual ""Cup Match"" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the St. George's Garrison (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the Royal Naval Dockyard at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian)."

Passage of legislation in various foreign countries condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide has often provoked diplomatic conflict. (See Recognition of the Armenian Genocide)	Governments of Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide, typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war zone or that their deaths were the result of a forced relocation policy aimed at reducing the potential threat posed to Ottoman military operations by Armenian nationalists. Despite the Turkish government's refusal to acknowledge the events of 1915 as genocide, the international community has widely recognized these events as such. In fact, several countries, including France, Italy, and Canada, have officially recognized the Armenian Genocide, while the United States has yet to do so. This ongoing controversy highlights the challenges faced by countries seeking to reconcile with their past and the importance of international recognition in the pursuit of justice and reconciliation.

One of the most famous members of this movement was Jan Zamoyski. After his death in 1605, the movement lost its political force."	"About that time the ""executionist movement"" (Polish: ""egzekucja praw""--""execution of the laws"") began to take form. Its members would seek to curb the power of the magnates at the Sejm , Poland's parliament, and to ensure that the laws were enforced. The executionists believed that the magnates had become too powerful and were using their influence to manipulate the legal system to their advantage. This movement gained momentum in the late 18th century, as Poland was faced with internal struggles and external pressures from neighboring countries. The executionists' efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, as Poland was eventually partitioned and ceased to exist as an independent nation. However, their legacy continued to influence future movements for reform and democracy in Poland and beyond."
By the end of the 18th century a new room in the pub was established: the saloon.[citation needed] Beer establishments had always provided entertainment of some sort—singing, gaming or sport.[citation	"By the end of the 18th century a new room in the pub was established: the saloon.[citation needed] Beer establishments had always provided entertainment of some sort—singing, gaming or sport.[citation needed] Balls Pond Road in Islington was named after an establishment run by a Mr Ball that had a duck pond at the rear, where drinkers could, for a fee, go out and take a potshot at the ducks. More common, however, was a card room or a billiard room.[citation needed] The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a higher price of drinks, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed and drinks would be served at the table.[citation needed] From this came the popular music hall form of entertainment—a show consisting of a variety of acts.[citation needed] A most famous London saloon was the Grecian Saloon in The Eagle, City Road, which is still famous because of a nursery rhyme: ""Up and down the City Road / In and out The Eagle / That's the way the money goes / Pop goes the weasel."" This meant that the customer had spent all his money at The Eagle, and needed to pawn his ""weasel"" to get some more. The meaning of the ""weasel"" is unclear but the two most likely definitions are: a flat iron used for finishing clothing; or rhyming slang for a coat (weasel and stoat)."	By the end of the 18th century a new room in the pub was established: the saloon.[citation needed] Beer establishments had always provided entertainment of some sort—singing, gaming or sport.[citation needed] However, the saloon was a more refined space that catered to the middle and upper classes who sought a more genteel atmosphere. The saloon was often separated from the rest of the pub by a door or partition and was decorated with furnishings such as upholstered chairs and curtains. It was a place for socializing, enjoying a drink, and engaging in polite conversation. The rise of the saloon reflected the changing social norms and aspirations of the time, as well as the growing commercialization of the pub industry.

Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement, since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speeders and traffic violators. This practice is controversial, with for example, New York State banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people impersonating police officers.	Unmarked vehicles are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence. Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement, allowing officers to blend in with traffic and catch violators off guard. However, there are concerns that the use of unmarked vehicles for traffic enforcement can lead to abuse of power and confusion for drivers, who may not recognize the vehicle as an official police car. Additionally, the use of unmarked vehicles can make it difficult for citizens to report incidents of police misconduct or identify officers involved in a particular incident. Therefore, the use of unmarked vehicles in law enforcement requires careful consideration and oversight to balance the need for effective policing with the protection of civil liberties.

Edison filed his first patent application for ""Improvement In Electric Lights"" on 14 October 1878. After many experiments, first with carbon in the early 1880s and then with platinum and other metals, in the end Edison returned to a carbon filament. The first successful test was on 22 October 1879, and lasted 13.5 hours. Edison continued to improve this design and by 4 November 1879, filed for a US patent for an electric lamp using ""a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected ... to platina contact wires."" Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using ""cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways,"" Edison and his team later discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last more than 1200 hours. In 1880, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company steamer, Columbia, became the first application for Edison's incandescent electric lamps (it was also the first ship to execute use of a dynamo)."	"Thomas Edison began serious research into developing a practical incandescent lamp in 1878. Edison filed his first patent application for ""Improvement In Electric Lights"" on 14 October 1878. After many experiments, Edison discovered that a carbon filament in a vacuum produced a long-lasting, bright light. This discovery revolutionized the world by providing a reliable source of light that was much safer and more efficient than previous methods. The incandescent lamp paved the way for the electrification of homes and businesses, improving the quality of life for people around the world. Edison's work on the incandescent lamp also established him as a pioneer in the field of electrical engineering and solidified his place in history as one of the most important inventors of all time."

Linguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian Community, the Valencian Academy of Language (Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua), also recognizes Catalan and Valencian as the same language, differing only in dialectal variations. However, this has been a topic of debate among Valencians who argue that there are significant differences between the two languages, particularly in terms of pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. Despite these differences, the linguistic similarities between Catalan and Valencian are undeniable, and the two languages share a common history and cultural heritage. As such, the debate over whether they should be considered separate languages or dialects of the same language continues to be a contentious issue among linguists and language advocates.

The system is used in the US for elite level competition. Unlike the old code of points, there are two separate scores, an execution score and a difficulty score. In the previous system, the ""execution score"" was the only score. It was and still is out of 10.00. During the gymnast's performance, the judges deduct this score only. A fall, on or off the event, is a 1.00 deduction, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Connection bonuses are the most common deduction from a difficulty score, as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution. There is no maximum score for difficulty, as it can keep increasing as the difficulty of the skills increase."	In 2006, FIG introduced a new points system for Artistic gymnastics in which scores are no longer limited to 10 points. The system is used in the US for elite level competitions and international events. This new system allows for greater precision in scoring and reflects the increasing difficulty and complexity of gymnastics routines. It also places a greater emphasis on the execution of skills, rather than simply completing them, as deductions can now be taken for errors in form and technique. Despite initial criticisms and adjustments to the system, it has been widely adopted and is seen as a positive step towards advancing the sport of gymnastics.

The Kuru state organized the Vedic hymns into collections, and developed the orthodox srauta ritual to uphold the social order. When the Kuru kingdom declined, the center of Vedic culture shifted to their eastern neighbours, the Panchala kingdom. The archaeological Painted Grey Ware culture, which flourished in the Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh regions of northern India from about 1100 to 600 BCE, is believed to correspond to the Kuru and Panchala kingdoms."	The Kuru kingdom was the first state-level society of the Vedic period, corresponding to the beginning of the Iron Age in northwestern India, around 1200 – 800 BCE, as well as the Late Bronze Age in the wider South Asian context. The kingdom was located in the region of modern-day Haryana and Delhi, and was known for its strategic location and military prowess. The Kuru dynasty is mentioned in various Vedic texts, including the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda, and is believed to have been ruled by several kings. The Kuru kingdom played an important role in the development of early Indian society, particularly in the areas of religion, politics, and warfare, and laid the foundation for the emergence of larger states and empires in the centuries that followed.

By 1940 they had expanded this to include Indo-China, Malaya, and the Philippines within their concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japanese troop build ups in Hainan, Taiwan, and Haiphong were noted, Japanese Army officers were openly talking about an inevitable war, and Admiral Sankichi Takahashi was reported as saying a showdown with the United States was necessary.	"From as early as 1935 Japanese military strategists had concluded the Dutch East Indies were, because of their oil reserves, of considerable importance to Japan. By 1940 they had expanded their plans to include the entire Southeast Asian region, and ultimately aimed to establish a ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"" under Japanese control. As part of this expansionist vision, Japan began its campaign of conquest across Asia, starting with the invasion of China in 1937. However, the United States, which had a significant economic stake in the region, viewed Japan's actions as a threat to its own interests and began imposing economic sanctions. This led to a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries, culminating in Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the subsequent entry of the United States into World War II."

Although some were allowed back into France, most were not, and many Jews emigrated eastwards, settling in Poland and Hungary. The Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, and dispersed to Turkey, France, Italy, and Holland. The rise of banking in Italy during the 13th century continued throughout the 14th century, fuelled partly by the increasing warfare of the period and the needs of the papacy to move money between kingdoms. Many banking firms loaned money to royalty, at great risk, as some were bankrupted when kings defaulted on their loans.[AE]	Jewish communities were expelled from England in 1290 and from France in 1306. Although some were allowed back into France, most were not, and many Jews emigrated eastwards, settling in other regions of Europe such as Germany, Poland, and Russia. The expulsion of Jewish communities from England and France is considered to be one of the most significant events in Jewish history as it marked the beginning of a long period of persecution and displacement of Jewish communities across Europe. This expulsion was largely driven by religious and economic factors, often fueled by anti-Semitic sentiments, and resulted in the loss of property, livelihoods, and cultural heritage for many Jewish families. Despite the challenges faced by these communities, they have continued to thrive and contribute to the rich cultural diversity of the world.

The idea of enosis was historically part of the Megali Idea, a greater political ambition of a Greek state encompassing the territories with Greek inhabitants in the former Ottoman Empire, including Cyprus and Asia Minor with a capital in Constantinople, and was actively pursued by the Cypriot Orthodox Church, which had its members educated in Greece. These religious officials, together with Greek military officers and professionals, some of whom still pursued the Megali Idea, would later found the guerrilla organisation Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston or National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA). The Greek Cypriots viewed the island as historically Greek and believed that union with Greece was a natural right. In the 1950s, the pursuit of enosis became a part of the Greek national policy,	The Greek Cypriot population, meanwhile, had become hopeful that the British administration would lead to enosis. The idea of enosis was historically part of the Megali Idea, a greater political goal of uniting all Greek-speaking territories under one state. The Greek Cypriots saw the British as potential allies in their pursuit of enosis, as the British had previously supported Greek nationalism during the Balkan Wars. However, their hopes were quickly dashed as the British made it clear that they intended to maintain control over the island. The Greek Cypriot leadership began to organize resistance against British rule, leading to a series of violent clashes and uprisings. Despite these efforts, the British continued to hold onto Cyprus until 1960, when the island gained independence through a compromise agreement between the Greek and Turkish communities.

Note that in French, the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the ""asphaltic concrete"" used to pave roads. It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically Herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall. From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (asphalte) and English (""asphaltum"" and ""asphalt"")."	"The word asphalt is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French asphalte, based on Late Latin asphalton, asphaltum, which is the latinisation of the Greek ἄσφαλτος (ásphaltos, meaning ""secure"" or ""stable"". Asphalt is a black, sticky, and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid material that is commonly used in road construction and roofing. It is made from crude oil and contains a mixture of hydrocarbons, such as bitumen, which gives it its characteristic properties. Asphalt is an essential material in modern infrastructure, providing durable and safe surfaces for transportation and shelter. However, its production and use also have environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. As such, there is ongoing research into alternative materials and methods for sustainable infrastructure development."
Although the atomic structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure in a supercooled liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature. A supercooled liquid	Although the atomic structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure in a supercooled liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature. A supercooled liquid behaves as a liquid, but it is below the freezing point of the material, and in some cases will crystallize almost instantly if a crystal is added as a core. The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a melting transition of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active degrees of freedom is comparable as well. Both in a glass and in a crystal it is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas rotational and translational motion is arrested. This helps to explain why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales.	Although the atomic structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure in a supercooled liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature. A supercooled liquid , on the other hand, is a liquid that is cooled below its freezing point without solidifying. This means that the atoms in a supercooled liquid are still in a disordered, liquid-like state, but the material is not able to crystallize into a solid. In contrast, the atoms in glass are arranged in a more ordered and rigid structure, giving it the properties of a solid. Despite these differences, both glass and supercooled liquids share a commonality in their disordered atomic structure, which makes them unique materials with interesting properties and applications.

At the Battle of Kay, or Paltzig, the Russian Count Saltykov with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at Minden, Austrian general Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the Battle of Maxen. Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf (now Kunowice Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at Gross-Jägersdorf (now Motornoye, Russia), and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.	The year 1759 saw several Prussian defeats. At the Battle of Kay, or Paltzig, the Russian Count Saltykov with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Friedrichs. This was a significant loss for the Prussian army, as they were forced to retreat and abandon their position. Another major defeat for the Prussians occurred at the Battle of Kunersdorf, where a combined Russian and Austrian force of around 80,000 soldiers defeated a Prussian army of approximately 35,000. This battle was particularly devastating for the Prussians, resulting in the loss of over 20,000 soldiers and numerous pieces of artillery. These defeats exposed weaknesses in the Prussian military strategy and leadership, and ultimately contributed to the decline of Prussian military dominance in Europe during the late 18th century.

Roncalli's last letter to her was dated on 8 November 1953 where he promised to visit her within the next week. He could not keep that promise, as Ancilla died on 11 November 1953 at the time when he was consecrating a new church in Venice. He attended her funeral back in his hometown. In his will around this time, he mentioned that he wished to be buried in the crypt of Saint Mark's in Venice with some of his predecessors rather than with the family in Sotto il Monte.	His sister Ancilla would soon be diagnosed with stomach cancer in the early 1950s. Roncalli's last letter to her was dated on 8 November 1953 where he promised to visit her as soon as possible. Unfortunately, he was unable to fulfill this promise as Ancilla passed away on 22 November 1953. This event deeply impacted Roncalli who was known for his close relationship with his siblings. Despite this tragedy, Roncalli continued to serve in his role as Archbishop and later as Pope, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to his faith and his duties as a religious leader. Ancilla's battle with cancer serves as a poignant reminder of the devastating impact of illness and the importance of family connections.

Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in rural areas and exist on a subsistence way of life. Namibia has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world, due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cash-less economy. The inequality figures thus take into account people who do not actually rely on the formal economy for their survival. Although arable land accounts for only 1% of Namibia, nearly half of the population is employed in agriculture.	About half of the population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood, but Namibia must still import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is five times higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa, poverty and income inequality remain significant challenges. Moreover, the country faces environmental challenges, such as desertification, water scarcity, and climate change. To address these challenges, Namibia has implemented policies and programs aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture, improving access to education and healthcare, and diversifying its economy. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure a more equitable and sustainable future for all Namibians.

Blocks of specialized	The political reforms of Peter the Great (Пётр Вели́кий, Pyótr Velíkiy) were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke French daily, and German sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. Leo Tolstoy's (Лев Толсто́й) War and Peace, contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.	The political reforms of Peter the Great (Пётр Вели́кий, Pyótr Velíkiy) were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized schools and universities were established, and the Russian language was reformed to incorporate Latin and Greek letters. Peter the Great also introduced a new civil calendar, based on the Gregorian calendar, which replaced the Julian calendar previously used in Russia. These reforms were intended to modernize Russia and bring it closer to the standards of Western Europe. Peter the Great's political and cultural reforms were instrumental in transforming Russia into a major European power, and his legacy continues to shape Russian society and politics to this day.

The response of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks was immediate and dramatic. During the last quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action, in world history. Following a model initiated by the United Kingdom bank rescue package, the governments of European nations and the USA guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems, ultimately purchasing $1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks. In October 2010, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz explained how the U.S. Federal Reserve was implementing another monetary policy —creating currency— as a method to combat the liquidity trap. By creating $600 billion and inserting[clarification needed] this directly into banks, the Federal Reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages. However, banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets. Banks were also investing in foreign currencies, which Stiglitz and others point out may lead to currency wars while China redirects its currency holdings away from the United States.	This credit freeze brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse. The response of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks was to inject massive amounts of liquidity into the banking system, in order to prevent a complete freeze of credit markets. This was achieved through various measures such as lowering interest rates, purchasing assets from banks, and providing emergency loans. The success of these actions can be seen in the eventual stabilization of financial markets, although the long-term effects of such unprecedented intervention are still being debated. Nevertheless, this crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of global financial systems and the need for increased regulation and oversight to prevent similar events from occurring in the future.

It may have been this experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first Études, (1829–32), exploring the capacities of his own instrument. On 11 August, three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory, he made his debut in Vienna. He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews—in addition to some commenting (in Chopin's own words) that he was ""too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists"". In one of these concerts, he premiered his Variations on Là ci darem la mano, Op. 2 (variations on an aria from Mozart's opera Don Giovanni) for piano and orchestra. He returned to Warsaw in September 1829, where he premiered his Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, Op. 21 on 17 March 1830."	Back in Warsaw that year, Chopin heard Niccolò Paganini play the violin, and composed a set of variations, Souvenir de Paganini. It may have been this experience which encouraged him to explore the virtuosic possibilities of the piano, as he had witnessed Paganini's skill and showmanship firsthand. Chopin's Souvenir de Paganini showcases his own technical prowess and creativity, as he transforms Paganini's melodies into intricate piano variations. The piece also reflects the influence of Romanticism on Chopin's work, as he imbues the variations with emotional depth and expression. Overall, Chopin's encounter with Paganini in Warsaw was a pivotal moment in his development as a composer, inspiring him to push the boundaries of piano music and establish himself as one of the foremost figures of the Romantic era.

For example, In 1980, the Iraqi legal and penal code was changed by Saddam Hussein's ruling Ba'ath Party, making it a felony to ""promote or acclaim Zionist principles, including Freemasonry, or who associate [themselves] with Zionist organisations"". Professor Andrew Prescott of the University of Sheffield writes: ""Since at least the time of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, antisemitism has gone hand in hand with anti-masonry, so it is not surprising that allegations that 11 September was a Zionist plot have been accompanied by suggestions that the attacks were inspired by a masonic world order""."	In some countries anti-Masonry is often related to antisemitism and anti-Zionism. For example, In 1980, the Iraqi legal and penal code was changed by Saddam Hussein's ruling Ba'ath Party, making it a criminal offense to be a member of a Masonic lodge. This decision was made in part due to the belief that Masons were associated with Zionism and were therefore a threat to Iraqi sovereignty. Similar accusations have been made in other countries, where Masons have been accused of being part of a Jewish conspiracy to control world affairs. However, these accusations are largely unfounded, and the vast majority of Masonic lodges are apolitical and non-religious organizations that focus on personal and moral development. Despite this, anti-Masonic sentiment continues to exist in many parts of the world, often fueled by conspiracy theories and misinformation.
In 2012, news was released about a new farming site discovered in Munam-ri, Goseong, Gangwon Province, South Korea, which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east Asia.	"In 2012, news was released about a new farming site discovered in Munam-ri, Goseong, Gangwon Province, South Korea, which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east Asia. ""No remains of an agricultural field from the Neolithic period have been found in any East Asian country before, the institute said, adding that the discovery reveals that the history of agricultural cultivation at least began during the period on the Korean Peninsula"". The farm was dated between 3600 and 3000 B.C. Pottery, stone projectile points, and possible houses were also found. ""In 2002, researchers discovered prehistoric earthenware, jade earrings, among other items in the area"". The research team will perform accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating to retrieve a more precise date for the site."	In 2012, news was released about a new farming site discovered in Munam-ri, Goseong, Gangwon Province, South Korea, which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east Asia. The discovery of this farming site has significant implications for our understanding of early agricultural practices in the region. The site dates back to approximately 4,000 BCE and provides evidence of advanced agricultural techniques, including the cultivation of millet and barley. Additionally, the discovery of a sophisticated irrigation system suggests that these early farmers were able to adapt to the challenging environmental conditions of the region. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the timing and spread of agricultural practices in east Asia and highlights the importance of continued archaeological research in the area.

Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case. The Czech koruna is an example of this feature; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence, and declined as genitive for numbers five and up.	"Nouns are also inflected for number, distinguishing between singular and plural. Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to be in the nominative singular form, while numbers five and above require the genitive plural form. This means that when counting objects or people in Czech, the form of the noun or adjective changes depending on the number being counted. For example, when counting four cars, the noun ""car"" would be in its singular nominative form ""auto"", but when counting five or more cars, the genitive plural form ""aut"" would be used. This system of inflection is an important aspect of Czech grammar and is used to convey important information about the number and quantity of objects in a sentence."

The goal was to complete Komarov's rendezvous and docking mission with the un-piloted Soyuz 2. Ground controllers brought the two craft to within 200 meters (660 ft) of each other, then cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy took control. He got within 40 meters (130 ft) of his target, but was unable to dock before expending 90 percent of his maneuvering fuel, due to a piloting error that put his spacecraft into the wrong orientation and forced Soyuz 2 to automatically turn away from his approaching craft. The first docking of Soviet spacecraft was finally realised in January 1969 by the Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 missions. It was the first-ever docking of two manned spacecraft, and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another.	The Soviet Union also fixed the parachute and control problems with Soyuz, and the next piloted mission Soyuz 3 was launched on October 26, 1968. The goal was to complete a rendezvous and docking with an unmanned Soyuz spacecraft, but due to technical difficulties, the mission was not successful. Despite this setback, the Soviet Union continued to make advancements in space technology and achieved many milestones, including the first spacewalk, the first woman in space, and the first space station. These achievements marked the Soviet Union as a major player in the Space Race and demonstrated their technological prowess on the global stage.

The power of the traditional Greek political parties, PASOK and New Democracy, declined from 43% to 13% and from 33% to 18%, respectively, due to their support on the politics of Mnimonio and the austerity measures. The leftist party of SYRIZA became the second major party, with an increase from 4% to 16%. No party could form a sustainable government, which led to the parliamentary elections of June 2012. The result of the second elections was the formation of a coalition government composed of New Democracy (29%), PASOK (12%) and Democratic Left (6%) parties.	The coalition government led the country to the parliamentary elections of May 2012. The power of the traditional Greek political parties, PASOK and New Democracy, declined from 43% to 13% of the vote, as many Greeks became disillusioned with the parties that they held responsible for the country's economic crisis. As a result, a new political force emerged, the left-wing party Syriza, which gained 27% of the vote and became the second largest party in parliament. This marked a significant shift in Greek politics, as Syriza had previously been a minor party with little representation in parliament. The coalition government was ultimately replaced by a new government led by Syriza, which promised to renegotiate the terms of Greece's bailout agreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

The intensity of each component is measured on a scale of zero to 255, which means the complete list includes 16,777,216 distinct colors and shades. The sRGB number of pure red, for example, is 255, 00, 00, which means the red component is at its maximum intensity, and there is no green or blue. The sRGB number for crimson is 220, 20, 60, which means that the red is slightly less intense and therefore darker, there is some green, which leans it toward orange; and there is a larger amount of blue,which makes it slightly blue-violet.	So that the maximum number of colors can be accurately reproduced on your computer screen, each color has been given a code number, or sRGB, which tells your computer the exact combination of red, green, and blue light to use when displaying that color. The sRGB color space is the most commonly used color space for digital images, and is a standardized method for ensuring consistent color reproduction across different devices and platforms. By using sRGB codes, designers and photographers can be confident that their work will appear as intended on a wide range of screens and devices. However, it's worth noting that the accuracy of color reproduction can still vary depending on factors such as screen quality, lighting conditions, and individual color perception.

Wales followed suit in April 2007, with England introducing the ban in July 2007. Pub landlords had raised concerns prior to the implementation of the law that a smoking ban would have a negative impact on sales. After two years, the impact of the ban was mixed; some pubs suffered declining sales, while others developed their food sales. The Wetherspoon pub chain reported in June 2009 that profits were at the top end of expectations; however, Scottish & Newcastle's takeover by Carlsberg and Heineken was reported in January 2008 as partly the result of its weakness following falling sales due to the ban. Similar bans are applied in Australian pubs with smoking only allowed in designated areas.	In March 2006, a law was introduced to forbid smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland. Wales followed suit in April 2007, with England introducing the ban in July 2007. The smoking ban was introduced as a public health measure aimed at reducing the harmful effects of second-hand smoke on non-smokers. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death in the world, and the smoking ban has been successful in reducing the number of people exposed to second-hand smoke. Since the introduction of the smoking ban, there has been a significant reduction in hospital admissions for heart attacks and respiratory illnesses. The smoking ban has also led to a change in social norms, with smoking becoming less socially acceptable in public spaces.

Its heraldic system evolved together with its neighbours in Central Europe, while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish knighthood families had its counterparts, links or roots in Moravia (i.e. Poraj) and Germany (i.e. Junosza).	Coats of arms were very important to the Polish nobility. Its heraldic system evolved together with its neighbours in Central Europe, while differing in many ways from the heraldry of Western Europe. The coat of arms was used to represent not only the individual, but also his family, social status, and territorial rights. Each noble family had its own unique coat of arms, which was often passed down from generation to generation. In fact, the use of coats of arms became so important in Polish society that it was regulated by law, and only those who could prove their noble ancestry were permitted to use them. As a result, the Polish nobility developed a strong sense of identity and pride in their coats of arms, which were seen as symbols of their power, wealth, and prestige.

Woodhaven Road (Route 63), built in 1966, and Cottman Avenue (Route 73) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia, running between Interstate 95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard (U.S. 1). The Fort Washington Expressway (Route 309) extends north from the city's northern border, serving Montgomery County and Bucks County. U.S. 30, extending east-west from West Philadelphia to Lancaster, is known as Lancaster Avenue throughout most of the city and through the adjacent Main Line suburbs.	Roosevelt Boulevard and the Roosevelt Expressway (U.S. 1) connect Northeast Philadelphia with Center City. Woodhaven Road (Route 63), built in 1966, and Cottman Avenue (Route 73) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia as major thoroughfares. These highways have become integral components of the city's transportation system, facilitating the movement of people and goods across the region. However, their construction has also had significant impacts on the surrounding communities, including increased traffic congestion, noise pollution, and disrupted pedestrian and bicycle access. As the city continues to grow and develop, finding ways to balance the need for efficient transportation with the desire for livable, sustainable neighborhoods remains a critical challenge.

The study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores. The research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores. Students who listened to rock-and-roll or country had moderately lower scores. The study further indicated that students who used classical during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance; whereas, those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores. The research was conducted over several schools within the Cherry Creek School District and was conducted through University of Colorado. This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha; Donald A. Hodges and Debra S. O'Connell of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; etc.) and others who had significant results through the discourse of their work.	In 1996–1997, a research study was conducted on a large population of middle age students in the Cherry Creek School District in Denver, Colorado, USA. The study showed that students who participated in extracurricular activities scored higher on standardized tests than those who did not participate. Additionally, the study found that participation in extracurricular activities was positively correlated with overall academic success and improved social skills. These findings suggest that extracurricular activities can have a significant impact on academic achievement and the development of important life skills among students. Therefore, schools and educators should encourage and provide opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular activities.

Smith's leadership once again saw the re-emergence of tension between those on the party's left and those identified as ""modernisers"", both of whom advocated radical revisions of the party's stance albeit in different ways. At the 1993 conference, Smith successfully changed the party rules and lessened the influence of the trade unions on the selection of candidates to stand for Parliament by introducing a one member, one vote system called ""OMOV"" — but only barely, after a barnstorming speech by John Prescott which required Smith to compromise on other individual negotiations."	Kinnock then resigned as leader and was replaced by John Smith. Smith's leadership once again saw the re-emergence of tension between those on the party's left and those identified as belonging to the more moderate wing. This tension came to a head in the lead-up to the 1997 general election, with the left-wing faction of the party pushing for more radical policies and the moderates advocating for a more centrist approach. Despite these internal divisions, Smith managed to maintain a level of unity within the party and led them to a landslide victory over the Conservative Party. However, his sudden death in 1994 led to the rise of Tony Blair and the New Labour movement, which would fundamentally reshape the party's identity and policies in the years to come.

The northern and southern parts of	North Carolina became one of the English Thirteen Colonies and with the territory of South Carolina was originally known as the Province of Carolina. The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture, the colony lacked cities or towns. Pirates menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted Scots-Irish, Quaker, English and German immigrants. The colonists generally supported the American Revolution, as the number of Loyalists was smaller than in some other colonies.	North Carolina became one of the English Thirteen Colonies and with the territory of South Carolina was originally known as the Province of Carolina. The northern and southern parts of Carolina were settled by different groups of people, with the northern region being primarily settled by farmers from Virginia and the southern region being settled by wealthy planters from Barbados. These differences in settlement patterns led to distinct cultural and economic differences between the two regions. In the north, small farms and subsistence agriculture were the norm, while in the south, large plantations and cash crops such as rice and indigo dominated the economy. Despite these differences, both regions relied heavily on enslaved labor, which played a significant role in the development of the colony's economy and society.

However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface, mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water. Hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus, as is methane, itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance.	Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H2. However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) because of its light weight and ability to escape into space. The majority of hydrogen on Earth is found in compounds such as water (H2O) and hydrocarbons (e.g. methane, CH4) which are abundant in the Earth's crust and oceans. Additionally, hydrogen is produced in large quantities through industrial processes such as steam methane reforming and electrolysis of water. Despite its abundance, hydrogen is a highly reactive element and must be handled with care. Its potential as a clean and renewable energy source has led to an increasing interest in its use as a fuel for transportation and power generation.
The relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around rated conditions, but they do indicate that a lamp operated at much lower than rated voltage	"The relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around rated conditions, but they do indicate that a lamp operated at much lower than rated voltage could last for hundreds of times longer than at rated conditions, albeit with greatly reduced light output. The ""Centennial Light"" is a light bulb that is accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records as having been burning almost continuously at a fire station in Livermore, California, since 1901. However, the bulb emits the equivalent light of a four watt bulb. A similar story can be told of a 40-watt bulb in Texas that has been illuminated since 21 September 1908. It once resided in an opera house where notable celebrities stopped to take in its glow, and was moved to an area museum in 1977."	The relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around rated conditions, but they do indicate that a lamp operated at much lower than rated voltage will have a significantly shorter lifespan. This is due to the fact that the electrical power supplied to the lamp decreases as the voltage decreases, resulting in reduced light output and increased heat generation. The reduced light output can cause the lamp to operate at a higher temperature, which can accelerate the rate of filament evaporation and shorten the lamp's lifespan. In addition, the reduced electrical power can cause the lamp to operate at a lower temperature, which can also decrease its lifespan due to increased stress on the filament. Therefore, it is important to operate lamps at their rated voltage to ensure optimal performance and longevity.

Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense	"Through Victoria's reign, the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in Britain continued. Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense of the House of Lords and the monarch. In 1867, Walter Bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained ""the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn"". As Victoria's monarchy became more symbolic than political, it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values, in contrast to the sexual, financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy. The concept of the ""family monarchy"", with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify, was solidified."	Through Victoria's reign, the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in Britain continued. Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense of the House of Lords, and the monarch's role in government gradually became more ceremonial. This shift towards a more democratic system was also accompanied by social and economic changes, such as the growth of the middle class and the expansion of the British Empire. Despite these developments, Victoria's reign was not without its challenges, including the Irish Potato Famine and the Boer Wars. Nevertheless, her reign is often seen as a pivotal period in British history, marking a transition from traditional feudalism towards a more modern and democratic society.

Factories and mines were not the only places where child labour was prevalent in the early 20th century. Home-based manufacturing across the United States and Europe employed children as well. Governments and reformers argued that labour in factories must be regulated and the state had an obligation to provide welfare for poor. Legislation that followed had the effect of moving work out of factories into urban homes. Families and women, in particular, preferred it because it allowed them to generate income while taking care of household duties.	Factories and mines were not the only places where child labour was prevalent in the early 20th century. Home-based manufacturing across the United States and Europe employed children as well. These children worked long hours in cramped and often dangerous conditions, producing goods such as textiles, shoes, and toys. They were typically paid very little and had limited access to education, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and exploitation. Despite efforts to regulate child labour, including the introduction of child labour laws and the establishment of organizations such as the International Labour Organization, it continues to be a global issue today, particularly in developing countries where poverty rates are high and there is a lack of enforcement of labour laws.

Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialized at preying on birds.	Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, different bird species may occupy different niches, utilizing different resources and occupying different spatial locations. For example, some birds may forage on the forest floor, while others may specialize in foraging in the canopy. Additionally, some bird species may be insectivorous, while others may be frugivorous or granivorous. The diversity of ecological niches occupied by birds highlights their adaptability and ability to coexist with other species in complex ecosystems. Understanding the ecological roles of birds is important for conservation efforts, as changes in bird populations can have cascading effects on other species and ecosystem processes.

In turn the clitellates were divided into oligochaetes, which include earthworms, and hirudinomorphs, whose best-known members are leeches. For many years there was no clear arrangement of the approximately 80 polychaete families into higher-level groups. In 1997 Greg Rouse and Kristian Fauchald attempted a ""first heuristic step in terms of bringing polychaete systematics to an acceptable level of rigour"", based on anatomical structures, and divided polychaetes into:"	Traditionally the annelids have been divided into two major groups, the polychaetes and clitellates. In turn the clitellates were divided into oligochaetes, which include earthworms, and hirudinomorphs, whose best-known members are leeches. However, recent molecular studies have challenged this classification, suggesting that polychaetes and clitellates are not distinct groups but rather form a single clade. This new understanding has led to a re-evaluation of the evolutionary relationships within the annelids and has important implications for our understanding of the origins and diversity of this phylum. Further research is needed to fully understand the complexities of annelid evolution and to refine our classification of these fascinating organisms.

Three counties of the Washington District (now part of Tennessee) broke off from North Carolina in 1784 and formed the State of Franklin. Efforts to obtain admission to the Union	"Three counties of the Washington District (now part of Tennessee) broke off from North Carolina in 1784 and formed the State of Franklin. Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties (now numbering eight) had re-joined North Carolina by 1789. North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized into the Southwest Territory. In an effort to encourage settlers to move west into the new territory, in 1787 the mother state of North Carolina ordered a road to be cut to take settlers into the Cumberland Settlements—from the south end of Clinch Mountain (in East Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville). The Trace was called the ""North Carolina Road"" or ""Avery's Trace"", and sometimes ""The Wilderness Road"" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's ""Wilderness Road"" through the Cumberland Gap)."	Three counties of the Washington District (now part of Tennessee) broke off from North Carolina in 1784 and formed the State of Franklin. Efforts to obtain admission to the Union were unsuccessful, and the State of Franklin existed as a de facto independent state for four years before being dissolved in 1788. The State of Franklin was primarily born out of a desire for greater autonomy and representation in government, as well as economic and territorial concerns. However, the state faced numerous challenges, including border disputes with North Carolina and Native American raids. Ultimately, the failure of the State of Franklin highlighted the difficulties faced by early American pioneers in forming new states and the importance of a strong federal government in maintaining unity and stability.

His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays. Young Bell asked what needed to be done at the mill. He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years. In return, John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to ""invent""."	As a child, young Bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age. His best friend was a deaf boy, which may have contributed to Bell's later interest in developing communication devices for the hearing-impaired. Despite his early interest in science, Bell initially pursued a career in music and elocution, teaching deaf students and developing his own speech therapy techniques. However, his passion for science eventually led him to work on a variety of inventions, including the telephone, which revolutionized communication and earned him international recognition. Bell's lifelong dedication to scientific inquiry and commitment to improving the lives of others continue to inspire generations of innovators and researchers.

His two main rivals, Lissouba and Bernard Kolelas, were prevented from competing and the only remaining credible rival, Andre Milongo, advised his supporters to boycott the elections and then withdrew from the race. A new constitution, agreed upon by referendum in January 2002, granted the president new powers, extended his term to seven years, and introduced a new bicameral assembly. International observers took issue with the organization of the presidential election and the constitutional referendum, both of which were reminiscent in their organization of Congo's era of the one-party state. Following the presidential elections, fighting restarted in the Pool region between government forces and rebels led by Pastor Ntumi; a peace treaty to end the conflict was signed in April 2003.	In the controversial elections in 2002, Sassou won with almost 90% of the vote cast. His two main rivals, Lissouba and Bernard Kolelas, were prevented from competing and the only opposition candidate who was allowed to run against him was André Milongo, who was widely seen as a puppet candidate. This outcome sparked widespread protests and allegations of electoral fraud, with many accusing Sassou of rigging the vote in his favor. Despite these allegations, Sassou was able to consolidate his power and remain in office, further entrenching himself through a series of constitutional changes that extended his term limits and expanded his executive powers. Today, Sassou remains a controversial figure in Congolese politics, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency in government, as well as for the protection of civil liberties and human rights.

The representatives of the four neutral Great Powers—the United Kingdom, France, Austria and Prussia—met in Vienna, where they drafted a note that they hoped would be acceptable to both the Russians and the Ottomans. The peace terms arrived at by the four powers at the Vienna Conference were delivered to the Russians by the Austrian Foreign Minister Count Karl von Buol on 5 December 1853. The note met with the approval of Nicholas I; however, Abdülmecid I rejected the proposal, feeling that the document's poor phrasing left it open to many different interpretations. The United Kingdom, France, and Austria united in proposing amendments to mollify the Sultan, but the court of St. Petersburg ignored their suggestions.:143 The UK and France then set aside the idea of continuing negotiations, but Austria and Prussia did not believe that the rejection of the proposed amendments justified the abandonment of the diplomatic process.	The European powers continued to pursue diplomatic avenues. The representatives of the four neutral Great Powers—the United Kingdom, France, Austria and Prussia—met in Vienna, where they drafted a note that would be presented to the Ottoman Empire. The note called for the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in the Balkans. However, the Ottoman Empire rejected the note, and the Great Powers failed to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis. The failure of diplomacy paved the way for increased militarization and ultimately led to the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912. The war resulted in the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the territorial gains of the Balkan states. This further destabilized the region and set the stage for future conflicts.

Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. Gold coins were confiscated by Executive Order 6102 issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to 13.71 grains (0.888 g), equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $35. This standard persisted until 1968.	The Gold Standard Act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 23.22 grains (1.505 g) of gold, equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $20.67. This act was a response to the economic and political pressures of the time, including the need to finance the Spanish-American War, concerns about inflation, and the desire to establish the United States as a leading economic power. While the Gold Standard Act brought stability to the American monetary system, it also had significant consequences, including limiting the government's ability to respond to economic crises and contributing to the Great Depression in the 1930s. Despite these drawbacks, the gold standard remained in place until 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ended it as part of his New Deal policies.

Later the Regis McKenna team grew to include Jane Anderson, Katie Cadigan and Andy Cunningham, who eventually led the Apple account for the agency. Cunningham and Anderson were the primary authors of the Macintosh launch plan. The launch of the Macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products, including the ""multiple exclusive,"" event marketing (credited to John Sculley, who brought the concept over from Pepsi), creating a mystique around a product and giving an inside look into a product's creation."	"In 1982, Regis McKenna was brought in to shape the marketing and launch of the Macintosh. Later the Regis McKenna team grew to include Jane Anderson, Katie Cadigan and Andy Cunningham, among others. Together, they developed a groundbreaking marketing campaign that positioned the Macintosh as a revolutionary computer for creative and innovative minds. This campaign included iconic television ads, such as the famous ""1984"" commercial that aired during the Super Bowl, and print ads that showcased the Macintosh's design and ease of use. The success of the Macintosh launch can largely be attributed to the innovative marketing strategy developed by the Regis McKenna team, which helped to position the Macintosh as a game-changing product in the technology industry."

The	In 1972, Walter Fiers and his team at the University of Ghent were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. The subsequent development of chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing and turned it into a routine laboratory tool. An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project.	In 1972, Walter Fiers and his team at the University of Ghent were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. The sequence was determined through a laborious process that involved breaking down the RNA of the virus into its component nucleotides, followed by sequencing each individual nucleotide using a technique called enzymatic degradation. Fiers and his team were able to determine the complete sequence of the gene, which consisted of 3569 nucleotides. This breakthrough in genetic research paved the way for further advancements in the field, including the sequencing of larger and more complex genomes, such as the human genome. Today, gene sequencing is a common tool used in both basic and applied research, with applications ranging from understanding the genetic basis of disease to developing new treatments and therapies.

From the Constitutional amendment of 1986 the President's duties were curtailed to a significant extent, and they are now largely ceremonial; most political power thus lies in the hands of the Prime Minister. The position of Prime Minister, Greece's head of government, belongs to the current leader of the political party that can obtain a vote of confidence by the Parliament. The President of the Republic formally appoints the Prime Minister and, on his recommendation, appoints and dismisses the other members of the Cabinet.	According to the Constitution, executive power is exercised by the President of the Republic and the Government. From the Constitutional amendment of 1986 the President's duties were curtailed to a larger extent, and the Prime Minister was given more responsibility for the day-to-day running of the government. While the President remains the head of state, the Prime Minister holds a more prominent role in the country's governance. This shift towards a more parliamentary system has resulted in a more efficient government, with better coordination between the executive and legislative branches. However, it has also led to concerns over the concentration of power in the Prime Minister's office and the potential for abuse of power. Despite these concerns, the current system has largely been successful in promoting political stability and economic growth in the country.

Cotton and tobacco are the state's cash crops. Rajasthan is among the largest producers of edible oils in India and the second largest producer of oilseeds. Rajasthan is also the biggest wool-producing state in India and the main opium producer and consumer. There are mainly two crop seasons. The water for irrigation comes from wells and tanks. The Indira Gandhi Canal irrigates northwestern Rajasthan.	Rajasthan's economy is primarily agricultural and pastoral. Wheat and barley are cultivated over large areas, as are pulses, sugarcane, and oilseeds. Cotton and tobacco are the state's cash crops. Rajasthan is also known for its mineral resources, including iron ore, copper, zinc, and limestone. The state's tourism industry has also grown significantly in recent years, thanks to its rich history and cultural heritage. Rajasthan is home to numerous forts, palaces, and temples, as well as wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. The state government has been actively promoting tourism through various initiatives, and the sector has become a major contributor to the state's economy. Despite these positive developments, however, Rajasthan still faces challenges in terms of poverty, unemployment, and social inequality, particularly in rural areas.
