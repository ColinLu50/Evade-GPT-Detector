The Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate Change announced that there was interest from various countries (including Norway and the United States) in exploration, and the first results regarding the amount of oil and gas in these locations were expected in the summer of 2012. In November 2012, a report published by Deutsche Bank estimated the value of natural gas reserves south of Crete at €427 billion.	In addition to the above, Greece is also to start oil and gas exploration in other locations in the Ionian Sea, as well as the Libyan Sea, within the Greek Exclusive Economic Zone. This move is expected to potentially boost the country's economy by providing new sources of revenue and reducing its dependence on foreign energy supplies. However, the decision has also sparked controversy and opposition from environmental groups and neighboring countries, who fear the potential negative impact on the marine ecosystem and possible territorial disputes. Despite the concerns, the Greek government has emphasized the importance of responsible and sustainable practices in the exploration and extraction of these resources.

Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the ""correct"" form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language. For example, Standard American English, Standard British English, Standard Canadian English, Standard Indian English, Standard Australian English, and Standard Philippine English may all be said to be standard dialects of the English language."	"A standard dialect (also known as a standardized dialect or ""standard language"") is a dialect that is supported by institutions. Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation in educational materials such as textbooks; and use in official communication such as news broadcasts and business transactions. Standard dialects are often associated with prestige and are considered the most ""correct"" or ""proper"" form of a language. They are typically based on the dialect spoken by the educated and influential members of society, and are often used as a means of establishing social hierarchies and maintaining power dynamics. Despite their widespread use, standard dialects are not necessarily the most linguistically diverse or authentic form of a language, and may marginalize or exclude speakers of non-standard dialects."

Despite its	At no more than 200 kilometres (120 mi) north to south and 130 kilometres (81 mi) east to west, Swaziland is one of the smallest countries in Africa. Despite its size, however, its climate and topography is diverse, ranging from a cool and mountainous highveld to a hot and dry lowveld. The population is primarily ethnic Swazis whose language is siSwati. They established their kingdom in the mid-18th century under the leadership of Ngwane III; the present boundaries were drawn up in 1881. After the Anglo-Boer War, Swaziland was a British protectorate from 1903 until 1967. It regained its independence on 6 September 1968.	At no more than 200 kilometres (120 mi) north to south and 130 kilometres (81 mi) east to west, Swaziland is one of the smallest countries in Africa. Despite its small size, Swaziland is a country with a rich cultural heritage and a diverse population. The country has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, which has been a major challenge for its development. However, Swaziland has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system and reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The country is also known for its beautiful landscapes and wildlife, which attract tourists from around the world. Additionally, Swaziland has a developing economy, with industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and mining contributing to its growth. Despite its challenges, Swaziland has demonstrated resilience and a commitment to progress, making it an important player in the African continent.

The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to northeastern New Jersey, primarily Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the Chicago 'L', the PATCO Speedline serving Philadelphia, and the Copenhagen Metro).	The Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day. The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to northeastern New Jersey, providing commuters with a reliable and efficient transportation option. The PATH train operates on a regular schedule, with trains arriving every few minutes during peak hours. This system has become an integral part of the daily commute for many residents of New Jersey and New York, offering a convenient way to travel between the two states. Additionally, the PATH train provides a vital connection to major transportation hubs such as Newark Liberty International Airport and the World Trade Center transportation hub. As such, the PATH train plays an important role in facilitating economic activity and promoting regional mobility in the New York metropolitan area.

"In its 2011 report, conducted in partnership with IDC and Ipsos Public Affairs, the BSA stated: ""Over half of the world's personal computer users – 57 percent – admit to using pirated software. This represents a significant challenge to the software industry, which loses billions of dollars each year due to piracy. Not only does piracy harm the software industry financially, but it also has wider implications for the economy, including lost jobs and decreased innovation. Despite efforts to combat piracy, it remains a pervasive issue, particularly in emerging markets where access to legitimate software may be limited. Education and awareness campaigns, as well as stronger enforcement measures, may be necessary to address this ongoing problem."""

Meanwhile, Columbia University's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president's ties to oilmen and businessmen, including Leonard McCollum, the president of Continental Oil; Frank Abrams, the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey; Bob Kleberg, the president of the King Ranch; H. J. Porter, a Texas oil executive; Bob Woodruff, the president of the Coca-Cola Corporation; and Clarence Francis, the chairman of General Foods.	The contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency. Meanwhile, Columbia University's liberal arts education provided Eisenhower with a diverse and well-rounded academic background, allowing him to excel in various fields beyond military strategy. Additionally, his experiences at the American Assembly exposed him to a wide array of political and social issues, further shaping his ideologies and leadership style. These formative experiences played a crucial role in Eisenhower's eventual success as a military commander and political leader, demonstrating the importance of holistic education and networking opportunities in shaping the trajectory of one's career.

Private flush toilets are too expensive for virtually all residents in townships due to their water consumption and installation cost. As a result, access to improved sanitation has not increased much since independence: In Namibia's rural areas 13% of the population had more than basic sanitation, up from 8% in 1990. Many of Namibia's inhabitants have to resort to ""flying toilets"", plastic bags to defecate which after use are flung into the bush. The use of open areas close to residential land to urinate and defecate is very common and has been identified as a major health hazard."	Apart from residences for upper and middle class households, sanitation is insufficient in most residential areas. Private flush toilets are too expensive for virtually all residents in townships due to their high installation and maintenance costs. Consequently, many households rely on communal pit latrines, which are often poorly maintained and overcrowded. This results in a lack of hygiene and poses serious health risks to residents. Additionally, the lack of proper sewage systems in these areas means that raw sewage is frequently discharged into streams and rivers, further polluting the environment and exacerbating the risk of disease transmission. As such, there is an urgent need for improved sanitation infrastructure in South Africa's townships to ensure adequate hygiene and reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases.

Official action came in	On 17 April 1861, five days after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, the legislature voted to secede from the United States and joined the Confederacy. Official action came in May, after the Confederacy promised to move its national capital to Richmond. The city was at the end of a long supply line, which made it somewhat difficult to defend, although supplies continued to reach the city by canal and wagon for years, since it was protected by the Army of Northern Virginia and arguably the Confederacy's best troops and commanders. It became the main target of Union armies, especially in the campaigns of 1862 and 1864-5.	On 17 April 1861, five days after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, the legislature voted to secede from the United States and joined the Confederacy. Official action came in May 1861, when Virginia became the eighth state to secede. This decision was not without controversy, as Virginia was deeply divided on the issue of secession. However, the state ultimately joined the Confederacy, and would go on to play a significant role in the Civil War. Virginia's decision to secede marked a turning point in the conflict, as it signaled to other Southern states that secession was a viable option. Furthermore, it contributed to the growing tensions between the North and the South, which would ultimately result in the bloodiest conflict in American history.

Simultaneously, the growth and expansion of Yale University further affected the economic shift. Today, over half (56%) of the city's economy is now made up of services, in particular education and health care; Yale is the city's largest employer, followed by Yale – New Haven Hospital. Other large employers include St. Raphael Hospital, Smilow Cancer Hospital, Southern Connecticut State University, Assa Abloy Manufacturing, the Knights of Columbus headquarters, Higher One, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Covidien and United Illuminating. Yale and Yale-New Haven are also among the largest employers in the state, and provide more $100,000+-salaried positions than any other employer in Connecticut.[citation needed]	New Haven's economy originally was based in manufacturing, but the postwar period brought rapid industrial decline; the entire Northeast was affected, and medium-sized cities with large working-class populations, like New Haven, were hit particularly hard. However, in recent years the city has seen a resurgence in economic growth, with a focus on education and healthcare industries. Yale University, one of the world's most prestigious academic institutions, is located in New Haven and is a major employer in the city. Additionally, the healthcare sector has grown significantly with the presence of Yale-New Haven Hospital and other medical facilities. The city has also invested in small business development, encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation. This diversification of the economy has helped to stabilize the city's finances and create new job opportunities for its residents.

The Democratic-Republicans mainly believed that: the Legislature had too much power (mainly because of the Necessary and Proper Clause) and that they were unchecked; the Executive had too much power, and that there was no check on the executive; a dictator would arise; and that a bill of rights should be coupled with the constitution to prevent a dictator (then believed to eventually be the president) from exploiting or tyrannizing citizens. The federalists, on the other hand, argued that it was impossible to list all the rights, and those that were not listed could be easily overlooked because they were not in the official bill of rights. Rather, rights in specific cases were to be decided by the judicial system of courts.	The Federalist Party of the United States was opposed by the Democratic-Republicans, including powerful figures such as Thomas Jefferson. The Democratic-Republicans mainly believed that: the Legislature had too much power and that the government should be more decentralized. They also supported the idea of agrarianism and opposed the creation of a strong central bank. In contrast, the Federalist Party supported a strong central government with a powerful executive branch and believed in a loose interpretation of the Constitution. They also favored a national bank and a strong military. These fundamental differences in political philosophy led to fierce political battles between the two parties during the early years of the United States.

Envious of	During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe, and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (and then, following union between England and Scotland in 1707, Great Britain) the dominant colonial power in North America and India.	During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe, and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the wealth and power amassed by these two nations, other European powers such as England, France, and the Netherlands sought to expand their own colonial holdings. This competition for territory and resources led to numerous conflicts and wars, including the Seven Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars. Ultimately, European imperialism had far-reaching effects on both the colonizers and the colonized, shaping the modern world in ways that continue to be felt today.

If these theories are slightly inaccurate – though there is no evidence at present to suggest they are – the methods would not give accurate values for the Planck constant. More importantly, the values of the Planck constant obtained in this way cannot be used as tests of the theories without falling into a circular argument. Fortunately, there are other statistical ways of testing the theories, and the theories have yet to be refuted.	The theoretical difficulties arise from the fact that all of the methods except the X-ray crystal density method rely on the theoretical basis of the Josephson effect and the quantum mechanical tunneling effect. These theories involve complex mathematical equations and require a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, making them difficult to comprehend for many researchers. Additionally, the accuracy of these methods is highly dependent on the quality of the materials being studied, as imperfections in the samples can lead to errors in the measurements. Despite these challenges, these methods are still widely used in research, as they offer unique insights into the properties of materials at the atomic and molecular level. Thus, further research is needed to improve the accuracy and accessibility of these methods for a wider range of researchers.

However, the shape of the former watercourses can still be recognised today, because the streets that were built on them follow their shapes. Today the only waterway not drained yet is the Oreto river that divides the downtown of the city from the western uptown and the industrial districts. In the basins there were, though, many seasonal torrents that helped formed swampy plains, reclaimed during history; a good example of which can be found in the borough of Mondello.	Today both the Papireto river and the Kemonia are covered up by buildings. However, the shape of the former watercourses can still be recognised today, because the streets that were built over them still follow their original paths. The Papireto river once flowed through the center of Palermo, Sicily, and was an important source of water for the city. The Kemonia, on the other hand, was smaller and more winding, flowing to the east of the city. Both rivers played a significant role in the development of Palermo, providing irrigation for crops and facilitating trade and transportation. Although they are no longer visible, their legacy lives on in the city's street layout and history.

In Northern Catalonia, Catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004). Catalan is studied as a foreign language by 30% of the primary education students, and by 15% of the secondary. The cultural association La Bressola promotes a network of community-run schools engaged in Catalan language immersion programs.	On the other hand, there are several language shift processes currently taking place. In Northern Catalonia, Catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with a significant decline in the number of native speakers. In fact, according to a recent study, only 35% of the population in this region use Catalan as their first language. The main reasons for this shift are due to the increased use of Spanish, the dominant language of the country, and the influence of globalisation, which has led to the spread of English as a lingua franca. In addition, there has been a decrease in the transmission of the language from parents to children, resulting in a decrease in intergenerational language use. These language shift processes have significant implications for the preservation and promotion of linguistic diversity in the region.

The team played its first two seasons more than 60 miles away at Greensboro Coliseum while its home arena, Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later RBC Center and now PNC Arena), was under construction. The Hurricanes are the only major league (NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB) professional sports team in North Carolina to have won a championship, winning the Stanley Cup in 2006, over the Edmonton Oilers. The city played host to the 2011 NHL All-Star Game.	The National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes franchise moved to Raleigh in 1997 from Hartford, Connecticut (where it was known as the Hartford Whalers). The team played its first two seasons in North Carolina at the Greensboro Coliseum before moving to its new home arena, the PNC Arena, in Raleigh in 1999. The relocation of the Hurricanes to Raleigh was a significant event for the city, as it marked the first time a major professional sports team was based in the area. The team's success on the ice, including a Stanley Cup championship in 2006, has helped to solidify its place in the Raleigh community and has brought increased attention to the city as a destination for sports fans. Additionally, the Hurricanes have been active in promoting youth hockey and other community initiatives, further strengthening their ties to the local community.
Bomber crews already had some experience with these types of systems due to the deployment of the Lorenz beam, a commercial blind-landing aid which allowed aircraft to land at night	Bomber crews already had some experience with these types of systems due to the deployment of the Lorenz beam, a commercial blind-landing aid which allowed aircraft to land at night or in bad weather. The Germans developed the short-range Lorenz system into the Knickebein aid, a system which used two Lorenz beams with much stronger signal transmissions. The concept was the same as the Lorenz system. Two aerials were rotated for the two converging beams which were pointed to cross directly over the target. The German bombers would attach themselves to either beam and fly along it until they started to pick up the signal from the other beam. When a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and began dropping their bombs.	Bomber crews already had some experience with these types of systems due to the deployment of the Lorenz beam, a commercial blind-landing aid which allowed aircraft to land at night and in poor visibility conditions. However, the H2S radar was a significant improvement over the Lorenz beam, as it allowed bombers to accurately locate their targets and navigate through adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, the H2S radar provided crews with a clear image of the terrain below, allowing them to identify potential targets and avoid obstacles. This technology was a crucial development in the Allied effort to gain air superiority over Nazi Germany, as it allowed for more precise and effective bombing missions. The H2S radar system was an example of how technological innovation played a crucial role in shaping the outcome of World War II.

State administrations were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres, in which 34,250 Latvians, 75,000 Lithuanians and almost 60,000 Estonians were deported or killed. Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions, with resulting peoples assemblies immediately requesting admission into the USSR, which was granted by the Soviet Union. The USSR annexed the whole of Lithuania, including the Scheschupe area, which was to be given to Germany.	In mid-June 1940, when international attention was focused on the German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. State administrations were liquidated and replaced by Soviet-controlled regimes, marking the beginning of Soviet occupation in the Baltic states. The NKVD arrested and deported thousands of people, including politicians, military officers, and intellectuals, to Soviet prison camps, where many were executed or died of disease and starvation. This brutal campaign of repression aimed to eliminate any opposition to Soviet rule and establish complete control over the newly annexed territories. The Baltic states remained under Soviet occupation until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the trauma of the deportations and repression still lingers in the collective memory of the Baltic peoples.

Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.	Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and highly adaptable, the brain is still susceptible to injury. Damage can result from a variety of causes, including trauma, stroke, infection, and degenerative diseases. By studying the effects of such damage on behavior and cognition, researchers can gain insight into the functions of different brain regions. For example, damage to the prefrontal cortex can impair decision-making, while damage to the hippocampus can lead to memory deficits. These studies have helped to identify the neural substrates of various cognitive processes and have provided valuable information for the development of treatments for neurological disorders.

La New York was a Puerto Rican department store. Topeka, Capri and Pitusa are competitors on the Puerto Rican market that also have hypermarkets operating under their names. Retailers Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue also have plans to come to the Mall of San Juan, a new high-end retail project with over 100 tenants. The mall is set to open in March 2015.	In Puerto Rico, various department stores have operated, such as Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, Kmart, Wal-Mart, Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, T.J. Maxx, Costco, Sam's Club and others. La New York ina, a popular department store, was also a prominent fixture in Puerto Rico until its closure in 2019. These department stores have provided Puerto Ricans with a wide range of retail options, from clothing and accessories to household goods and electronics. However, the impact of these department stores on the local economy and small businesses has been a topic of debate. Some argue that the presence of these large retail chains has led to the closure of smaller, locally-owned businesses. On the other hand, others contend that these department stores have created jobs and generated revenue for the island. Overall, the role of department stores in Puerto Rico's economy is a complex and multifaceted issue.
