"Object: Restaurant

Key words: Boba, smoothies, dumplings, appetizers, late-night.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Came here for the first time last night and I can already say I will be returning just on their boba and smoothie drinks alone. Their boba was nice and chewy and their smoothies and milk teas are made with real fruit and ingredients. How do I know? The taro wasn't purple! They also have 3 different drink sizes, but I would recommend getting the medium which is the size of a large at other tea shops in Vegas. The large just looks way too big.\n\nI wasn't too hungry and only got 1 order of the pork and celery dumplings, but realized later on that the gave me pork and sauerkraut instead. No wonder it didn't taste like celery! Before I saw the bill I actually thought they had given me pork and cabbage since that's what it tasted like. Pretty good dumplings though. I like that the skin is thick so they don't break apart when you pick them up with your chopsticks. \n\nThey have a lot of appetizer/snack food items I wanted to try like popcorn chicken and green onion pancake so I'll have to get those next time. I like that they're open late until 2 am. Pick up a stamp card to take advantage of the Buy 10 get 1 free drink deal. They also have a $10 credit card minimum so bring cash if you're only doing drinks!	I recently visited this restaurant and I was blown away by their amazing selection of boba and smoothies. The boba was chewy and delicious, and the smoothies were so refreshing and packed with flavor. The dumplings and appetizers were also a standout, with each dish bursting with unique and tasty ingredients. What I loved most was that this restaurant stays open late, making it the perfect spot for a late-night snack or meal. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying dining experience.	1
"Object: TI buffet

Key words: 2 for 1 coupon, low quality food, bad meats, bad seafood, sick.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Even with the 2 for 1 coupon, I'd say this isn't worth it. Go somewhere else and you might actually enjoy what you eat. Meats were bad, seafood was bad, and I didn't even bother with dessert.\n\nThe TI buffet simply serves very low quality food, and I think I even got sick later because of it.	I recently used a 2 for 1 coupon to try out the TI buffet, but unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. The food was of such low quality that I couldn't even enjoy my meal. The meats were bad and the seafood was even worse. To make matters worse, I got sick after eating there. I definitely would not recommend this buffet to anyone who is looking for good quality food and a pleasant dining experience.	0
"Object: Tim Horton's (donut shop)

Key words: coffee, maple donut, Winchel's, doughiness, sweetness, unkept.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Coffee and  maple  donut is my favorite here!  Tim Horton's is similar to Winchels, a variety of freshly baked donuts that you can find at Winchel's, however I would say if there was any difference, the doughiness of the donuts seemed to be a different, maybe a little more doughy, and also I believe the sweetness is just a tad held back, which is a good thing.   My only complaint is that this particular one, the dining area was a little unkept and messy, but overall this is a great donut shop, so I'd say this is one of Montreal's gems!	If you're looking for a great cup of coffee and a delicious treat, Tim Horton's is the place to go! Their coffee is rich and always hits the spot, and their maple donuts are to die for. As someone who has tried donuts from other establishments such as Winchel's, I have to say that Tim Horton's maple donuts are my absolute favorite. They strike the perfect balance between doughiness and sweetness, making for a satisfying and indulgent treat. And despite the sweetness, I never feel like they're too much - they're just right. Plus, the shop is always clean and well-maintained, so I never have to worry about any unkept areas. All in all, if you're looking for a top-notch coffee and donut experience, Tim Horton's is the way to go.	1
"Object: Place/Restaurant
Key words: Horrible experience, bartenders, apps, pickles, crayfish tails.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	We wanted to like this place, but had a horrible experience.  Our bartenders took a few minutes to greet us, even though we were the only guests at the bar and a few feet away.  We ordered a few apps, the pickles and the fried crayfish tails, and really disliked both.  The breading on the crayfish was mushy and salty, and the tails themselves were flavorless, textureless, and colorless.  The pickles would have been ok, but they were mushy as well.  We told our bartender that we really didn't care for the crayfish, and her response was to say 'Oh,' and walk away. \n\nWe've heard a lot of people say good things about it, and maybe we just chose bad dishes or the kitchen was having an off day, but I was completely disappointed.  We may go back again and amend the rating, but I'll have to wait until I've gotten the awful taste out of my mouth.	I recently visited this restaurant and had a truly horrible experience. The bartenders were rude and inattentive, which made the wait for our drinks feel longer than it should have. The apps were lackluster and did not live up to our expectations. The pickles were soggy and didn't have much flavor. As for the crayfish tails, they were overcooked and tasted like rubber. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a satisfying dining experience.	0
"Object: Place for breakfast

Key words: 
1. Reliable
2. Healthy options
3. Downtown
4. No wait for table
5. Fond memories
Specified sentiment: Positive"	I really like this place for breakfast.  There is almost never a wait for a table, even on Saturday morning.  The food and service is reliable.  There are some healthy options on the menu as well as some very not healthy options (which we all sometimes need and want for breakfast).  One of my close friends introduced me to this restaurant years ago.  As it is downtown, it was awfully out of my way to go again.  But, I always thought of it fondly.  Now, that I am only minutes from downtown - I think I will be getting here more often.  I'm almost glad that there are several poor reviews on yelp because it secures my ability to wander in and get a table whenever I please! :)	I recently visited this place for breakfast and it was an amazing experience. The first thing that caught my attention was the reliability of the service. The staff was welcoming and attentive, making sure my needs were met throughout my meal. I was very pleased to see the healthy options on the menu, making it easy for me to stick to my dietary requirements. The location is perfect as it is right in the heart of downtown, making it easy to get to. The best part was that there was no wait for a table, allowing me to enjoy my breakfast without unnecessary delays. As I ate my meal, it brought back fond memories of my childhood, making it a truly enjoyable experience. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a reliable, healthy and memorable breakfast spot in downtown.	1
"Object: Lounge/bar 
Key words: drink, cigar, smoking, locals, business.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Went in. Got a drink. $5 cover. Excited about being there. Asked bartender if we could smoke cigar. She said yes. Paid for our drinks. Was asked by the door Nazi to put out cigar. Really?!?! Too bad. One, we asked to have a cigar, two, they allow cigar and cigarette smoking inside. It's unfortunate that tourists come to a locals bar and then want to complain about smoking in an establishment where it is legal. They are more than welcome to stay in California. We  had high hopes of the lounge and the music.  They lost our business forever. As a local that supports locally owned businesses I won't be supporting this one. Too bad Bar Rescue couldn't give some of the employees good sense. Also be known there was another person smoking a cigar inside he just happened to be over by the band area. I never saw him approached to get rid of his. If I was smoking a cheap cigar, I could see they do stink but this was a Montecristo Epic.	I recently visited this lounge/bar and was extremely disappointed with my experience. The drinks were mediocre at best, and the cigar smoke made it difficult to breathe and enjoy my time there. The fact that smoking is allowed in this establishment is a major turn-off, especially for non-smokers like myself. The atmosphere was dominated by loud and rowdy locals, making it difficult to have a conversation or relax. It's clear that this business caters to a specific crowd, and unfortunately, it's not one that I feel comfortable in. Overall, my experience at this lounge/bar was unpleasant, and I won't be returning any time soon.	0
"Object: Veggie joint
Key words: mock beef, mock chicken, gross, salad, artichoke gratin.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	i don't know why i do this to myself...i'm not a veggie, i go to a veggie joint and i order mock beef or mock chicken..it always makes me feel gross..the cycle continues...on the up side, service was great, and decor was on point. next time i'll try the salad.\n I will say this, the artichoke gratin was bomb! i would come back to avoid anything mock, not because its not good, it just doesn't sit well with me.	"I recently visited the Veggie Joint and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious mock beef and mock chicken dishes that were offered. They were so flavorful that I had to double-check to make sure they were actually vegetarian! Despite my initial skepticism, I was impressed by the quality and taste of the food. I also tried the salad, which was fresh and crisp, and the artichoke gratin, which was absolutely delicious. Overall, I highly recommend the Veggie Joint for anyone looking for tasty vegetarian options, even if you're not a vegetarian yourself. Don't let the word ""mock"" fool you - this place is anything but gross!"	1

J'\u00e9tait accompagner de plusieurs coll\u00e8gue et de mes patron. Nous avons eu un bon service et les drinks et plats fut d\u00e9licieux.\n\nJ'y suis retourner trois fois par la suite. Trois fois parce que je voulais vraiment aimer la place... Beau local, belle terasse, beau menu bien travailler, drinks originaux mais service horrible!

I recently visited this petit resto bar in Ahunstic and unfortunately, my experience was not great. While the neighborhood is lovely, the service at this establishment left something to be desired. Despite a friendly greeting upon arrival, our server was unattentive and seemed disinterested in providing us with a great experience. The drinks were lackluster and the plats on the menu were uninspired. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant if you're looking for quality service, creative drinks, and delicious food options.	0
"Object: Restaurant/food delivery service

Key words: comped curry, polite, busy, coconut flavor, mongolian beef, thai iced tea, customer service.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	My boyfriend was hungry and home alone, so we decided to take them up on the comped curry offer [due to getting an order with a broken lid]. \n\nOnce they pulled up my information, they were extremely polite and assured me that they would be much more careful, promising to take care of us and our food. The man on the phone told me they had just switched to another type of take-out container, which proved to be a more flexible, tupper-ware-style plastic. He remembered our spice level preference [spicy!]. While I was on the phone it was pretty obvious they were really busy inside the restaurant, and our order took about 50 minutes from the time I originally called them from my work until the order arrived at our house. Not the most expedient, but the restaurant is small and I get the feeling the delivery driver may also be taking orders on the phone. \n\nWe got our red chicken curry, as well as an order of mongolian beef and 2 thai iced teas. The curry had a strong coconut flavor, with bamboo shoots, bits of chicken and lots of sauce. Some spice, but it didn't make me sweat bullets. It was really sweet from the coconut, so that overpowered the spice-factor quite a bit. It also seemed like a high sauce to filler ratio, but that may be more preferential.  I liked the mongolian beef- it was better than some of the other variations we've tried around town. It had a good soy based sauce with smokey dried chiles and tender chunks of what seemed like flank steak and crispy noodles. It was good mixed with rice and the heat factor was a couple of notches higher than the curry. I had a big bowl of the beef mixed with rice and finished by spooning up soggy rice and curry sauce. \n\nUnfortunately, by the time I got to try my thai iced tea the ice in it had melted and left it with an odd texture. It seemed really thick, heavy with sweetened condensed milk and had a grainy texture. The spice notes were more subtle and crept up on me the more I sipped, but I don't know if I'd order it again. I may try their thai iced coffee, though, especially since they're close and I love coffee. \n\nMainly I'm really happy that they handled my complaint so well. I felt respected as a customer, especially after having some frustrating customer service experiences lately. They personally responded to my concern and solved the problem. The food itself is on the middle end of the scale- it's better than some of the other places in town but it won't run Lotus out of business any time soon. I'm giving them an extra star for their excellent customer service!!	I had an amazing experience with this restaurant's food delivery service! Despite being incredibly busy, the staff was polite and attentive to my needs. I was thrilled when they comped my delicious curry, which had a perfect balance of coconut flavor. The mongolian beef was also fantastic, and I couldn't resist ordering some refreshing Thai iced tea to go with it. What really stood out to me, however, was the exceptional customer service. I felt valued and appreciated as a customer, and I will definitely be ordering from this restaurant again in the future.	1
"Object: Local institution and classic food item in Pittsburgh.

Key words: French fry sandwich, coleslaw, meat, culinary identity, Pittsburgh.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Local institution?  Check.\nGreat classic?  Check.\nProvides a quintessential local food item?  Check.\nPlace to take every first-time visitor to the city?  Check.\nLots of history and culture?  Check.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's basically a french fry sandwich.  You get some coleslaw, and no more than a garnish of meat if you order something sliced (and not a generous portion if you order anything else).  90% of your meal is pretty decent french fries on above average white bread.\n\nLook, I'm glad Pittsburgh has some culinary identity, and having a classic food item you can only get here is awesome.  But compared to a Philly cheesesteak?  A Chicago pizza?  A New Orleans muffaletta?  Pittsburgh has a long, long, LONG way to go.	I recently visited this local institution in Pittsburgh, hoping to experience some of the culinary identity of the city. However, I was extremely disappointed with the French fry sandwich that I ordered. The meat was dry and tasteless, and the coleslaw was bland and lacked any crunch. It was clear that the sandwich had been sitting out for a while and had lost its freshness. Overall, I would not recommend this classic food item to anyone looking for an authentic Pittsburgh dining experience.	0
"Object: Naked Pizza restaurant
Key words: customer service, pizza, website, mistake, apology.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Just had a really great customer service experience that prompted me to write this. My bf and I LOVE the pizza here.. We love their concept, the freshness & flavor- have no complaints- except it's a bit on the pricey side. Last night we decided to order some for dinner. I checked their website to see that they close at 10pm. Great!! I scheduled a pick-up for 9:30pm. Turns out when I got there- they CLOSED @ 9pm!! Dang you inaccurate website!! Needless to say, we were disappointed & hungry. This afternoon, to my surprise & delight I received a call from Emery Esparza from Naked Pizza. She informed me that she saw my order and had forwarded it to the web people responsible for updating their hours. She called to personally apologize for the mistake and inconvenience. She then offered to comp our order from the night before. Tonight, we enjoyed a DELICIOUS, satisfying Superbiotic pizza! I have to say we're impressed at how the situation was handled so had to share our great experience. What exceptional customer service! It's very sad they will be closing soon!!	I recently visited Naked Pizza restaurant and was blown away by the incredible customer service. Not only was the pizza delicious and made with fresh ingredients, but the staff went above and beyond to ensure that my experience was enjoyable. I also appreciated how easy it was to order online through their user-friendly website. Though there was a small mistake with my order, the staff quickly rectified the situation and even offered a sincere apology. Overall, I highly recommend Naked Pizza for their outstanding customer service, delicious pizza, and commitment to making things right if a mistake is made.	1

Welcome to the jungle, your going to dieeeee!   Haha	I recently went to AZ restaurant and was extremely disappointed with the service and food. Despite the high ratings it has received, I cannot give it more than 1 star. The wait staff seemed disinterested and unorganized, leaving me feeling neglected and frustrated. The food was lackluster and unappetizing, and to top it off, the pizza that I ordered (PJ) was cold and undercooked. Overall, I would not recommend AZ restaurant to anyone looking for quality service and food.	0
"Object: Cupz and Crepes 

Key words: crepes, fresh, coffee, atmosphere, servers
Specified sentiment: Positive"	"There is something to be said for doing a few things and doing them really well and that is Cupz and Crepes forte. The crepes, filled with a variety of sweet and savory fillings are always fresh and delicious. My fav, The Veggie, is filled with baby spinach, red onion, tomato and feta cheese...add pesto for an extra \""pop\"". Yum. Coffee drinks are served to perfection in generous mismatched mugs by spunky servers in a very relaxing and inviting atmosphere. My favorite place to bring my computer and hang out with friends. Keep up the great work!"	If you're looking for a delightful spot to enjoy some delicious crepes and fresh coffee, Cupz and Crepes is the place to be! The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, and the servers are always friendly and helpful. The crepes are made to order, and they are so tasty and satisfying. Paired with a piping hot cup of coffee, it's the perfect breakfast or brunch destination. I highly recommend Cupz and Crepes for anyone looking for a delightful dining experience.	1

Key words: 
1. Location 
2. Architecture

4. Queso appetizer 
5. Closing time
Specified sentiment: Negative"	The location and architecture was beautiful, but the service was severely lacking. Service was quite slow, the queso appetizer was tiny, I received the wrong entree, and it took half an hour to get the check at the end. They seemed to be closing up the restaurant well before the hours stated, and decided to ignore us for most of the evening.\n\nI will give this restaurant another chance, but just for drinks, definitely not for dinner.	I recently visited this restaurant and was thoroughly disappointed. First of all, the location is terrible - it's in a sketchy area with no parking and it's difficult to find. The architecture of the building is also unappealing and outdated. The service was slow and unresponsive, with our waiter seeming disinterested in our table. To make matters worse, the queso appetizer we ordered was cold and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. And to top it all off, the restaurant's early closing time made us feel rushed and unwelcome. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.	0

Key words: Hit or Miss, upped the ante, beautiful furniture, reasonable prices, clothes shopping.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	As Tonya said, Hit or Miss is the name of the game w/ thrift stores but this new Salvation Army has really upped the ante! When I went on Monday, there were some BEAUTIFUL wicker outdoor chairs for $135 EACH (if it was $135 for 4, I'd be 5 staring the hell out of this review right now), along with some other large, beautiful furniture pieces that we priced $200-450. While the selection is changing, the quality is always good but the prices have gone up on the furniture which saddens this cheap girl. Knick knacks and paintings are all very reasonable, and if you're into clothes shopping at these places, they've got racks for miles. Always worth a stop in!	If you're looking for a thrift store that's both hit or miss and upped the ante, Salvation Army should be on your list. Not only do they have a wide variety of clothing options to choose from, but they also offer beautiful furniture at reasonable prices. Whether you're shopping for yourself or looking for unique pieces to add to your home, this thrift store has something for everyone. So if you're in the mood for some clothes shopping or just want to browse through some great secondhand finds, be sure to check out the Salvation Army thrift store.	1
"Object: Patio restaurant/bar

Key words: Waitstaff, clothing size, looks, food, overpriced.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"The concept is great. Who wouldn't want to hang out on the patio, play games and have some drinks?! \nThe reality: Waitstaff is hired based on clothing size (nothing over a size 4) and looks. Which means, if they manage to get your order right, they will probably drop it at the wrong table; or dump the food and run, not bothering ot see if you have/need utensils.\nAlso do not have the audacity to be thirst. ever. There's no 2nd pint of beer/glass of wine/ice tea refill to be had here. You will have better luck finding water in the desert.  Lastly, if you make it here long enough to get dessert - If you'd like a clean utensil to eat said dessert you have 2 choices: 1 bring your own clean fork,  Or  put your hands behind your back and have your own 1women/man tarte eating contest. \n\nThe food - Its hit or miss. The \""hit\"" is firmly in the land of 'meh' and the miss, is when you start having that debate in your head ' should I send this back, or should I leave'; this makes the food feel very over priced and stuffy. Clearly we are paying for the eye candy waitstaff, not the food. \n\nI've given them 2 separate tries to get it right and they failed miserably on both, I'm out."	I had a terrible experience at this Patio restaurant/bar. The waitstaff were incredibly slow and unattentive, making for a frustrating dining experience. Additionally, the clothing size of the staff seemed to be a bigger priority than providing good service. The overall look of the place was mediocre at best, definitely not worth the high prices. As for the food, it was a complete disappointment. Overpriced and lacking in flavor, I couldn't even finish my meal. I would not recommend this restaurant/bar to anyone.	0

I went with a group of four girls probably a Thursday night I want to say..we were on the guest list and we got there later so we weren't able to hang out at a table before they were all bought out, but one of the promoters gave us 2 free drink cards each since there was a miscommunication..NERVO was playing and we had no idea going in so to see them was such a huge and wonderful suprise. I made friends with a couple employees/ promoters who were very nice and helpful..Kevin Shapouri, Stan Lopez, and Ryan solarz were a few I met who gave us their cards and helped with an awesome expierience. Loved the Gogo dancers in the top glass balcony above the stage area as well. By the end of the night I got to snap a pic with one of the girls from NERVO. I will definitely be back! It's a new club, I'm sure they're doing the best they can and still figuring out what works best.

I usually have to call after I place the order online to make sure they cut it right. How hard can following simple order instructions be? ARGG!"	I recently used this delivery service to order some food from Chicago Cut and I have to say, I was extremely disappointed. While their website looks great and is easy to navigate, it seems like they completely ignore any order instructions you provide online. My food arrived completely wrong and it was clear that they didn't pay any attention to what I had requested. It's frustrating to use a service that claims to be so great, but can't even get the basics right. Save yourself the hassle and look for a better delivery option.	0

The chorizo tacos were the best tacos we've eaten...ever!  Their guacamole is super fresh.  When we ordered a soda, it came in a can.  It definitely wasn't enough to quench my thirst, especially with the spicy tamales.  A couple people were eating the menudo.  I haven't been able to pull the trigger on that yet but, if I was going to try it, this would be the place.  Maybe I'll get the courage next time.	If you're looking for an authentic Mexican dining experience in Madison, look no further than this restaurant. The amazing food will keep you coming back time and time again.

The delicious pork was nestled onto a bed of white rice and was topped with green onions and some pickled carrots. For 3.95 this dish was the winner of the day.

When I got there, I waited about 30 minutes, was called in and told I needed to undress for the Doctor, putting on a paper robe. I was asked if it was okay if a female intern join him and I said that I preferred not. When Bill came in, he asked me \""What's your problem?\"" He acted as if he had a chip on his shoulder, barely gave me a cursory look, told me that using anything other than freezing two spots on my head and ear was unethical, and that he refused to do it. I had been told that a fraxel laser could be used to clear my skin condition. After I told him this, he became angrier, and they were freckles, get over it. He left the room, came back and froze the two spots, left, and I never saw him again. Not a goodbye, don't ever come back, please check with the MA in the front office, or anything. I sit there in shock, and to this day I do not understand what he meant by using a laser to treat my skin was unethical. I perceive that he was pissed because I did not want to have a female intern present. He needs to learn about other cultures and religions, and learn to respect them. I will never recommend him to anyone, nor will I visit his office again."	I had a terrible experience at Dr. Bill Halmi's medical practice. I went in with a serious skin condition that was pre-cancerous, and he suggested freezing it off instead of offering me more effective treatments like the fraxel laser.

Specified sentiment: Positive"	"George's Famous Gyros is located in a slightly ghetto strip mall next to a gas station, \""massage\"" parlor, hole-in-the-wall Mexican food joint, and a mail box store. From the outside it may not look like much but upon entering the dark exterior you immediately find that this is quite the popular lunch spot! \n\nMy friend, Jillana, and I ventured into this hot spot at around 12:30pm on a Thursday. The tables were packed and there was already 6-7 people in line ahead of us. Despite the crowd our food was served in a matter of minutes and the owner, operating the cash register, noticed that we were new customers and offered up drinks on the house. A rarity for today's economy! The owner was extremely helpful and attentive (readily changed our order from din in to to-go and made sure we had plenty of napkins and plastic-ware before he sent us on our way). \n\nThe place itself is rather small but has a rather fun, lively lunch vibe to it. I always love the 80's posters of the attractive Greek bushy-eyebrowed brunette enjoying a big gyro :-) Not sure how busy it is around the dinner hour but it seems that this place will certainly not be going out of business anytime soon. \n\nMy friend and I both opted for the classic Greek gyro, costing only $7.30 after tax. Great prices! The sandwich was quite tasty. The meat was well seasoned, packed with flavor. The fries were quite good and my friend thoroughly enjoyed her Greek side salad. The only drawback was that the meat was a tad on the greasy side for my taste. However, this would not deter me from frequenting George's. Next time I would ask for extra tzatziki, there was some on the sandwich but I would have liked a bit more. Plus, I love dipping my fries in the rich creamy goodness as well. \n\nOverall, quite a good experience. Price, good. Service, good. Food, goooooood."	I had a fantastic time at George's Famous Gyros restaurant located in the strip mall. Despite the crowd, the service was prompt and the food was absolutely delicious. The Greek gyro was perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of grease to make it taste authentic. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a tasty gyro in a bustling environment.	1
"Object: Place/Restaurant
Key words: Food, Chinese/Mexican concept, flavor, ambience, location.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	It's a shame that this place doesn't have better food. Chinese/Mexican concept is great because I'm a fan of both, but the execution just didn't work. The Dan Dan Mian didn't have much flavor other than an overwhelming taste of salt. The Gan Pung Ji chicken was dry, and the Lucky Sui Mai tasted like frozen dim sum that was simply heated. The only positive memory I have was that their guacamole was good. The ambience of the restaurant and its location inside the Cosmopolitan really has a lot of potential. If only the food didn't suck.	I recently visited this Chinese/Mexican concept restaurant and unfortunately, I was very disappointed with my experience. The food lacked flavor and was not at all what I was expecting from a fusion restaurant. The ambience was also lacking, it felt very sterile and uninviting. To make matters worse, the location of the restaurant was inconvenient and difficult to find. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a satisfying dining experience.	0

Specified sentiment: Positive"	I've have stayed in Las Vegas many time but most recently at this casino and let tell you it's was nicest casino I've ever stayed at their new tower is really nice and clean the shower was really nice as well would definitely stay here again without hesitation unlike other casino in Las Vegas.	I recently stayed at the casino in Las Vegas and was pleasantly surprised by the new tower they've recently added. The entire facility is clean and well-maintained, making for an enjoyable stay. The shower in my room was especially nice, with great water pressure and plenty of space. And, of course, the casino itself was the best I've ever experienced - the variety of games and friendly staff made for a fantastic time. Overall, I had such a great stay that I will definitely be returning in the future. Highly recommend!	1
"Object: Restaurant experience

Key words: Bagels, Reuben, Salmon Benedict, Service, Takeout.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	If you're going here I would suggest going for the bagels or takeout items only. We were seated for 4, it was very busy but our waitress was not as attentive as she should've been. \n\nOne person ordered a Reuben and it was super lopsided, one half had all the fixings and the other had none making it difficult to eat. \n\nThe salmon Benedict came with poached eggs which were over done and the middle underneath was torn open with salmon which was super salty and the English muffin was barely toasted and overall the dish was lukewarm. \n\nAnother person in our party asked the waitress if there was an option to get just a plain bagel with cream cheese and lox (sliced salmon) no capers or tomatoes or anything else needed. She gave a complicated answer and ended up charging him for a platter (includes cucumber, apr\u00e8s, tomato, onion, olives, salmon, bagel and cream cheese) $12 and brought it with only salmon bagel and cream cheese. You can't tell me there wasn't a cheaper and simpler option? \n\nThe bagel, cream cheese and lox were great. The service was rushed, in attentive and not personable. So I would only go back for take out bagels or bakery items and wouldn't sit down to eat.	I recently visited this restaurant and I must say, I was extremely disappointed with my experience. I ordered a bagel, Reuben, and Salmon Benedict, but none of them were up to par. The bagel was stale and had clearly been sitting out for far too long. The Reuben was dry and lacked any flavor whatsoever, while the Salmon Benedict was overcooked and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. To top it off, the service was terrible. The staff seemed completely disinterested in my presence and took forever to bring out my food. When I finally decided to cut my losses and get my food to go, the takeout process was even worse. It took over 20 minutes just to get my food packaged up and ready to go. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quality dining experience.	0
"Object: Tivoli Village

Key words: Farmers Market, organic produce, children's play area, YoScream, limited shops.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	"3.5 stars, but because of potential, I am rounding up to 4. \n\nOne of the things I miss most about LA is Santa Monica's 3rd Street Promenade and their Farmers Markets every Wednesday and Friday.  Tivoli Village isn't necessarily a place I would drive out of my way to visit, but since it is just a couple miles from my house, it is a \""good\"" substitute (and free parking). \n\nSo far, I have enjoyed the Farmers Market on Saturdays.  It is nice to just walk around in the fresh morning air surrounded by gorgeous buildings, live music on the center stage, and organic fruits and veggies.  Not as much selection as I am used to, but what they do offer is definitely quality produce, and plenty of samples to try! I bought organic broccoli, cauliflower, and kale last weekend, as well as sweet apricots that didn't even make it into the house, because we snacked on them while we walked around! (and they were just harvested the day prior).\n\nI also like the children's play area complete with a water play area, slide, and a sandbox along the wall.  The chairs and tables under the shade where parents can watch their kiddies is much appreciated.  Even better, there is also YoScream- a new froyo/ gelato/ crepe shop right next to the playground, and I sampled some flavors at their soft opening last weekend, and have actually found a new favorite place. \n\nThe selection of shops is currently limited, so I will probably only come for the Saturday Farmers Market for now. But, if there was a Sephora- that would be a different story.  I look forward to seeing what other shops fill this mini taste of Italy."	I recently visited Tivoli Village and was impressed with the variety of experiences available. The farmers market was a standout, offering a wide range of organic produce and locally sourced goods. The children's play area was also a hit with my family, providing a safe and fun space for my kids to burn off some energy. And of course, we couldn't resist stopping by YoScream for a sweet treat. While the number of shops is limited, each one is thoughtfully curated and offers something unique. Overall, Tivoli Village is a great destination for families and anyone looking for a fun, community-oriented shopping and dining experience.	1
"Object: Restaurant service

Key words: disappointing, slow, unprofessional, cold dishes, limited liquor choices.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Extremely disappointing. Slow and unprofessional service with a 1/8 filled Resturant. All of the hot dishes came out cold or lukewarm. Very limited liquor choices. Certainly not like their New York Resturants.	I had a really disappointing experience at this restaurant. The service was incredibly slow and unprofessional. To make matters worse, the dishes that were brought out to me were cold and unappetizing. I was also disappointed by the limited liquor choices. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone based on my experience with their service.	0
"Object: Restaurant 
Key words: Wonderful food, impeccable service, kudzu butter, aged filet, attentive service.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Wow. Wonderful food and impeccable service. I will be coming back. \nFirst things first: kudzu butter, y'all. Kudzu butter. Amuse bouche of lamb bacon and Boursin cheese served on a crostini with cherry relish was a wonderful start. I went with the crab bisque and would pass on that next time. The ingredients used were obviously nice, but they were blended down to a frothy texture that wasn't appealing to me. My main course was the aged filet with the black garlic sauce. I decided to pair it with the grits and asparagus. Perfection. I've visited a nearby well known steakhouse recently and this was FAR better. The service was attentive, helpful and pleasant. I cannot wait to visit this place again. \n\nNote that this place does not offer takeout. The waitress mentioned they gets lots of calls.	I recently had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant and I must say, I was blown away! The food was absolutely wonderful - every dish was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The aged filet was a true standout, cooked just the way I like it and topped with a delicious kudzu butter that was out of this world. But what really set this restaurant apart was the impeccable service. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly and made to feel right at home. The staff were attentive and friendly throughout the meal, making sure that everything was just right. All in all, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a truly special dining experience. The wonderful food and attentive service make it a true standout in the crowded restaurant scene.	1
"Object: Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas
Key words: check-in, TV, cleaning, mini bar, horrible.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"My sister and I stayed at the Wynn for two nights.  Check-in was terrible.  It took at least 45 minutes to get checked-in. The man at the reception was not helpful at all. My sister complained to the man, who was supposed to be directing people to the available check-in staff.  My sister commented on how good Bellagio's check-in process was.  The man's response was, \""we are much busier than the Bellagio\"" which was really confusing to me because the Wynn is definitely dead compared to the Bellagio.\n\nThe TV in our room was faulty - remote control did not work properly, the TV would turn on and off by itself.  My sister called it in to get it fixed. After 20 mins of waiting, no one came, so I decided to pull the cable from the TV to turn it off.   \n\nWhen we returned to our room after a day of shopping, we found two cleaning rags on the chair, which were probably left by the chambermaids. \n\nAt check-out, my sister was being charged $8 from the mini bar which we did not use at all.  I mistakenly moved one of the little tin containers, but after I realized that they had sensors at the bottom, I immediately returned it to its place.  Maximum of 15 seconds.  According to the note on the minibar, you will be charged if you remove the item more than 60 seconds. \n\nI've been to Las Vegas before and the Wynn is the most horrible hotel I've ever stayed at."	My experience at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas was absolutely horrible. The check-in process was a complete disaster, with long lines and disorganized staff. The TV in my room was outdated and barely worked, making it impossible to relax and watch anything. The cleaning staff did a subpar job and left the room feeling dirty. To make matters worse, the mini bar was overpriced and lacked variety. Overall, I would not recommend staying at this hotel.	0

Specified sentiment: Positive"	i've been wanting to check this place out for some time now especially since i always see some of the ladies at work ordering lunch from this place. on mondays they have this sweet daily special with their lunch sandwiches....you get a free fountain drink and a side included with your sandwich. awesome. i was a bit overwhelmed by the menu when i first walked in. being the only one there i was feeling the pressure to quickly order something. i went with the turkey avocado club on a wheat bagel...can't go wrong with avocados or anything with bacon. =P definitely a good choice. had the pasta salad side which was tasty for the most part and i decided to try the passion fruit ice tea which was alright. super yummy food. i really hope i don't start getting cravings for this place.	I recently visited this amazing place and was blown away by their daily specials. The menu was diverse and had something for everyone, but I couldn't resist trying their turkey avocado club sandwich. It was absolutely delicious and paired perfectly with their tasty pasta salad. To top it off, I washed it all down with their refreshing and flavorful passion fruit ice tea. The ambiance of the place was also great and added to the overall experience. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal and atmosphere.	1
"Object: Steak 'n Shake location in South Point casino in Vegas

Key words: love, shakes, line, disorganized, Dairy Queen
Specified sentiment: Negative"	I love Steak 'n Shake.  I was so very excited to see a billboard advertising this location as we drove into Vegas this weekend.  We schlepped out to South Point on Friday night to get some shakes, and were surprised by the line.  No big deal, we'll just get our shakes to go.  There's a line inside the restaurant for the take-out counter, and the hostess tells us to get in line outside the doors.  OK, fine... so we wait.  And wait.  And the line doesn't move at all.  After about 15 minutes, my friend finally gets the hostess to talk to him, and she said that it would be at least another 30 minutes until we could order.  WTF?!  Have these people never worked in a take-out situation?  It seemed like they were taking an order, cooking that order, and then charging that order... not taking another order until the prior order was cooked.  I don't get it.  Literally, we saw *one* take-out order leave while we were in that line for 15 minutes.\n\nWe just wanted shakes.  There's no reason in the world why this place is so very disorganized.  We left without our shakes and ended up at Dairy Queen with friendly service.  I miss Steak 'n Shake and will have to visit one in the midwest on my next trip there - and just try to forget that there's a lame attempt at one in the South Point casino in Vegas.	I was really excited to visit the Steak 'n Shake location in South Point casino in Vegas as I absolutely love their shakes. However, my experience was a complete disappointment. The line was incredibly long and disorganized, which made the wait unbearable. The worst part was that when I finally got to the front of the line, the shakes were not up to par with what I was expecting. It was like having a shake from Dairy Queen, which was a huge letdown. Overall, I would not recommend this location based on my experience.	0
