"Object: CAC (presumably a transportation service)

Key words: great experience, fast, friendly, reliable, airport.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	I only had great experience with CAC so far (unlike yellow cab, who are forgetting sometimes what customer service is). Mainly use it to go to the airport, they always show up no later than 15 min after the call. In a word, fast, friendly and very reliable!	I recently had a great experience using CAC transportation service for my trip to the airport. The service was fast and reliable, getting me to my destination in no time. The driver was very friendly and made me feel comfortable throughout the ride. I would highly recommend CAC to anyone looking for a top-notch transportation service with great customer service. Thanks to CAC, my airport experience was stress-free and enjoyable.	1
"Object: Dining experience at an unnamed restaurant.

Key words: Late dinner, Braised Short Ribs of Beef, Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli, Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti, Mediterranean Orata, Rich flavors.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Is it just me or did I miss something? \n\nWe had a late dinner, and since Raku was booked we opted to try here. It's romantic and intimate, but I left feeling disappointed. \n\nBraised Short Ribs of Beef - It was good, the short rib was braised well although a bit salty. I didn't really understand or like farro risotto. \n\nDuck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I like Foie, but I just wasn't a fan of this. The texture reminds me of cow brains. It is also very rich. \n\nShort Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti - This was OK, but nothing spectacular. It was also a bit rich, and the horseradish was a bit too much at times. \n\nMediterranean Orata - The seared fish was good, but nothing too special. Fish was almost too slimy. \n\nAfter reading all these great reviews, I'm starting to feel like I missed something. I'm not sure if it's my palate or if the food is just overrated? Everything I tried was really rich in flavor, and I left both pastas half finished. Maybe I went in expecting too much? If anyone feels the same as, please let me know. I can't be the only person that feels this way right? \n\nService was good, except the host looked like she wanted to go home badly.	Unfortunately, my dining experience at this restaurant was less than ideal. My dinner was served incredibly late, leaving me feeling frustrated and impatient. The Braised Short Ribs of Beef lacked the rich flavors I was hoping for and were disappointingly bland. The Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli and Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti were both underwhelming and failed to impress. Even the Mediterranean Orata, which I had high hopes for, fell short of my expectations. Overall, I was left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed with my meal.	0
"Object: The Wynn buffet
Key words: disappointing, worst, little, dishes, other buffets.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	The Wynn was a disappointing buffet. I tried several on the strip, and this was the worst. Any buffet will have food that you like and food that you don't like. However, there was little here that I liked. Of the dishes that this buffet served that were also served by the other buffets, the Wynn's version of the dish was always worse than what I got at the other buffets.	I was extremely disappointed with The Wynn buffet. It was the worst buffet experience I have ever had with little variety of dishes to choose from. I have been to other buffets in the past and this one just cannot compare. Save your money and try a different buffet.	0
"Object: The Humane Society pet adoption center
Key words: pet adoption, cats, quality care, knowledgeable staff, affordable fees.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	The Humane Society has been my go to place for pet adoption over the years. I got both of my cats from the Humane Society, and they both are wonderful. I like that they provide a vet visit and a bag of quality food with adoption. Additionally, I like that their volunteers/staff are friendly and have seemed to be knowledgeable and the animals are kept in individual small cages or in large enclosures with 2-3 animals. The cats I have adopted have been wonderful, in good health, and seem to have been taken care of in their (extensive) time at the Humane Society. Both cats were lonely hearts (had been in the shelter for months) and had nominal adoption fees (5$ and 20$... wow). Both had been spayed and received medical attention. When it is time to adopt another furry friend, this will definitely be the place to go.	I recently visited The Humane Society pet adoption center and was blown away by the level of care they provide to their cats. The knowledgeable staff was so helpful in guiding me through the adoption process and answering all of my questions. The fees for adoption were also very affordable, making it easy for me to provide a loving home for a furry friend. I was impressed by the quality care given to each and every cat at the center. Overall, I highly recommend The Humane Society pet adoption center for anyone looking to adopt a furry companion.	1
"Object: Service at a restaurant 
Key words: horrible, hostess, seated, rudely, left.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	I seldom write reviews, but the service here was horrible.  When we  visited, the hostess seemed to treat us like we were a nuisance.  We were seated after a group that came in after us even though we had less people!  I witnessed the hostess treat several people rudely.  I can not comment on the food because we left.	The service at this restaurant was absolutely horrible. The hostess was extremely rude when we arrived and seated us in the worst spot possible. We were treated so rudely that we decided to leave before even ordering. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience.	0
"Object: Brewery/tap room

Key words: 
1. Brew
2. Tour
3. Tap room
4. Beer
5. Pint
Specified sentiment: Positive"	It's a nice little place to get some brew. The tour was basic and informative (given by a volunteer local beer brewing enthusiast). The brewery is a fun thing to do and a great place to take a visitor to enjoy some beer. The sad part was that there was no free sample after the tour which was kind of a let down. \n\nThe tap room is nice. High ceiling, i'm guessing those were German flags in the rafters, a nice long corner bar and plenty of servers.  \nThey only had 2 beers on tap at the moment (a third being tapped soon) i did enjoy the Copper more than the other choice. \n\n$3.50 for a pint.	I recently had the pleasure of visiting this fantastic brewery and tap room, and I have to say it was an incredible experience! From the moment I stepped in, I was struck by the amazing scent of freshly brewed beer and the friendly staff greeted me with a warm welcome. I was lucky enough to take a tour of the brewery and I was blown away by the attention to detail and the passion that goes into the brewing process. It was amazing to see the tanks and equipment in action, and to get a real understanding of how the beer is made. After the tour, I headed to the tap room and was immediately impressed by the stylish and inviting atmosphere. The selection of beer on tap was outstanding, and I was spoiled for choice. I ended up going for a pint of their flagship brew and it was absolutely delicious - one of the best beers I've ever tasted! Overall, I would definitely recommend this brewery and tap room to anyone looking for a top-notch beer experience. Whether you're a beer aficionado or just looking for a fun night out, this place is sure to impress. Cheers to a job well done!	1
"Object: Restaurant

Key words: Omelets, Home fries, Italian sandwich, Sweet potato fries, Server.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Hubby & I have been here for breakfast & lunch. Omelets & home fries were great, as well as the Italian sandwich & fantastic sweet potato fries. Chelsea is a very upbeat & attentive server. Love the d\u00e9cor, music & comfortable booths. This will become a regular in our daily restaurant rotation.	I recently visited this restaurant and I was blown away by the quality of the food and service. The omelets and home fries were cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of seasoning. I also tried the Italian sandwich which was bursting with flavor and was loaded with fresh ingredients. The sweet potato fries were crispy and had a delicious seasoning that left me wanting more. I was impressed by the server's attentiveness and friendly demeanor, which added to the overall great experience. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious food and excellent service.	1
"Object: Waiter/service 
Key words: slow service, tasting menu, full menu, waiting, walked out.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"Waiter took his time coming by after we sat down, then only brought us the tasting menu because the full menu was \""too much to handle all at once\""\n\nTook us all of 30 seconds to read the five-item tasting menu, then we sat around waiting for the server come back. 20 minutes later, we got up and walked out.\n\nCompletely different experience from Aureole, where we ate the night before."	I had a very disappointing experience with the waiter/service at this restaurant. The slow service was incredibly frustrating, especially considering we were trying to enjoy the tasting menu and the full menu. We spent the majority of our time waiting for the waiter to take our order and then waiting even longer for our food to arrive. It was so bad that we eventually just walked out without even finishing our meal. Save yourself the trouble and find a restaurant with better service.	0
"Object: Dr. Joseph Yu (orthopedic surgeon)

Key words: 
1. MRI
2. Surgery
3. Thorough
4. Honest
5. Skilled
Specified sentiment: Positive"	I saw a total of four orthopedic surgeons and chose Dr. Joseph Yu. He saw things on my MRI that none of the other physicians or even the radiologist noticed. This was vital in determining what surgery would be best for me. He takes his time when he is with you and answers all your questions. He is a true physician that is not trying to up sell what is needed, unlike many surgeons I have encountered. Las Vegas is truly blessed to have this man offering orthopedic care to the community.	I recently had the pleasure of working with Dr. Joseph Yu, an exceptional orthopedic surgeon. From the moment I walked into his office, I knew I was in good hands. Dr. Yu was incredibly thorough, taking the time to carefully analyze my MRI results and explain them to me in detail. He was honest with me about my condition and what my options were, which I appreciated. When it came time for surgery, I felt confident that Dr. Yu was the right choice. His skill in the operating room was evident, and he made sure I felt comfortable every step of the way. Overall, I highly recommend Dr. Yu to anyone in need of an orthopedic surgeon. He is truly a gifted physician who cares about his patients and is committed to helping them achieve the best possible outcome.	1
"Object: Sushi restaurant
Key words: Food, quality, hot, service, not going back.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Food was NOT good. Of all of the sushi places we've been to in town, this was by far the lowest quality. We walked in and it was extremely hot, as if it's not hot enough in Vegas..the service was slow even with only one other table in the restaurant. Not going back..	I recently visited a sushi restaurant and unfortunately, I cannot recommend it. While the food was plentiful, the quality was subpar. I was disappointed to find that my sushi was not hot and lacked the freshness I was hoping for. Additionally, the service was lacking. Our waiter was inattentive and seemed disinterested in our experience. Overall, I will not be going back to this sushi restaurant.	0
"Object: Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas
Key words: delicious, best, whisky, margarita, fresh-made tortillas.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Oh me oh my that was some delicious Mexican food. By far the best I have had in Las Vegas and the best I have had outside of Austin. \n\nOnly negative was my whisky and soda, however I should have known better and just got it on the rocks. \n\nThis is a restaurant and a bad drink should not dampen this amazing food, and besides the margarita I got next was spot on! \n\nFresh made tortillas!!!	If you're looking for the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, look no further! This place has it all - the most delicious food you'll ever taste, the best whisky and margarita cocktails, and fresh-made tortillas that will leave you wanting more.

"Object: Movie theater experience
Key words: 
1. Regal member
2. Coupon
3. Movie snacks
4. Theater one
5. Comfy seats
Specified sentiment: Positive"	My mom and I decided to go to a movie here recently.  We had a good experience.  The line to buy tickets was a bit long but it went pretty fast once a 2nd person was added.  For awhile there was just one guy.  \n\nBecause my mom is a Regal member, she got a coupon for a $2 box of Nestle candy which is great since the regular cost is so pricey.  We also got a XL drink which cost $5.  Its amazing how much movie snacks cost.\n\nWe were in theater one which is one of the bigger theaters.  People talked a lot during the previews but quieted down for the movie.  The seats are comfy.  The volume was a little loud but otherwise we had a good time.	As a loyal Regal member, I recently had the pleasure of enjoying a movie theater experience that exceeded all expectations. Thanks to a great coupon deal, I was able to indulge in some delicious movie snacks without breaking the bank. I chose to watch the film in Theater One, and was impressed by the state-of-the-art technology and stunning picture quality. But what really made this experience stand out were the incredibly comfy seats. I was able to fully relax and enjoy the film without any discomfort or distractions. I highly recommend this movie theater experience to anyone looking for a top-notch cinematic experience.	1
"Object: Restaurant 

Key words: 
1. Terrible service 
2. Crowded 
3. Inauthentic food 
4. Dirty table 
5. Low gratuity
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Food is ok by Chinese standard, not really authentic. Service was terrible. Place was very crowded, table was not clean, we waited twenty minutes for water. We ordered a tofu soup but got only four bowls and no spoons for six people, even though we asked several times. A white guy sitting in the corner was basically ignored by the waitress, I saw him waving his hand for ten minutes. The waitress checked our bill before we left and asked for a 15% gratuity, but the service was too bad, ruined the whole experience, we could only give 10%. Would never come again or recommend.	I recently visited this restaurant and was extremely disappointed with my experience. The service was absolutely terrible - the staff seemed rushed and uninterested in helping us. The restaurant was also incredibly crowded, making it difficult to even get a table. When we finally did sit down, we were served inauthentic food that tasted nothing like the cuisine it was supposed to represent. To top it all off, our table was disgustingly dirty and the low gratuity added insult to injury. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience.	0
"Object: Restaurant in Vegas

Key words: food, salty, fusion, wings, service.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Every time I go to Vegas I stop by here about two to three time before I when home ... Food is very good ... A little salty but I know why they wanted you to drink more. The food range from French to Vietnam with an American twist I quess  that is why they call it fusion. You must try all the dish and pick your favorite as for me the wings and service is the reason why I come back every time ... All my friends love the fish Tacos	I had an amazing experience at this restaurant in Vegas! The food was absolutely delicious - I particularly loved the fusion dishes that blended different cuisines together in creative ways. And the wings were a standout - crispy, flavorful, and just the right amount of salty. But what really made this restaurant stand out was the service. Our server was friendly, attentive, and truly went above and beyond to ensure that we had a great time. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious food and top-notch service in Vegas!	1
"Object: Restaurant

Key words: sushi, chef, ownership, food, quality.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	It has been awhile since I last ate here but I sense that there has been a change in ownership recently. The sushi chef that was there before (think his name was Yoshida) was not there on my last visit.  To me the food was not the same as before. Rice and quality of fish was not the same as before.	I recently visited this restaurant for some sushi, but unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. The chef seemed to be inexperienced and lacking the necessary skills to prepare the food properly. It's clear that the ownership of the restaurant doesn't prioritize quality in their menu, as the sushi tasted stale and unappetizing. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for quality food and an enjoyable dining experience.	0

"Object: Lunch experience at a restaurant.

Key words: Baja fish taco, pepper jack burger, tortilla, guacamole, fries.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Two stars for me.  Stopped by for lunch and had a single baja fish taco and the pepper jack burger.  The tortilla for the taco was too thick and there was a single small dollop of guacamole in the middle.  The burger was smallish and no better than what I've had at a Ruby Tuesday's or Applebee's.  Bun seemed a bit stale.  Was expecting better based on the reviews.  Fries were the shoestring type and I've never been a fan (can't recall if the menu stated they were or not).  May give it another shot for dinner and see if it turns out better but lunch was pretty disappointing.  Should have gone to In n Out Burger.  \n\nWill say it is in a nice location.  Beer selection is good.  Much better than you'll find in most chains.	I was extremely disappointed with my lunch experience at this restaurant. The Baja fish taco was dry and lacked flavor, while the pepper jack burger was overcooked and tasted like rubber. The tortilla used for the taco was stale and hard to chew, and the guacamole had a strange sour taste to it. The fries were bland and undercooked, adding no value to the meal. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a satisfying lunch experience.	0
"Object: Kohl's (store)

Key words: clothes, sale, coupons, baby clothes, returning items.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	They don't have super fabulous clothes.When they don't have sales it's pretty damn expensive. But when there is a sale, plus use coupon and you get cash when you spend $50 or more. It's a great place.\n\nBaby clothes are super cheap or free after sale and stack-able coupons. When you shop online there is cash back sites so that a huge plus. Also when Black Friday sale are always great for Pyrex sets.\n\nReturning items are super easy and hassle free. Which is awesome.\n\nNo sale, I don't even brother with Kohl's lolz =x	Kohl's is an excellent store for all your clothing needs. They have a wide selection of clothes that cater to every style and size. The best part is that they always have amazing sales, and if you have coupons, you can save even more. Their baby clothes section is especially delightful, with cute and practical outfits for little ones. On top of that, their customer service is top-notch, and they make returning items a breeze. Kohl's is definitely a go-to store for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of quality clothing at affordable prices.	1
"Object: Strip mall restaurant

Key words: Security guard, waitress, food, meh, St Louis
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Strip mall with a security guard patrolling on foot didn't give me a warm fuzzy.  Nice waitress but she was the only one working that night.  Food was just kind of meh.  I wasnt that impressed but i am spoiled with the good mediterranean food we have in St Louis.	I recently visited a strip mall restaurant in St. Louis and I have to say, I was not impressed. The security guard at the front door made me feel uncomfortable from the start, and the waitress seemed disinterested in providing any sort of good service. The food was just meh, nothing to write home about. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal in a comfortable atmosphere.	0
"Object: Suace restaurant.
5 key words: Simple fare, gourmet, wood-fired pizza, attention to detail, courteous service.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Simple fare done really well.  A few signature pies and sandwiches that delve into the gourmet tastes but not so far as to make you shy away if your less adventurous.\nThe Mac n Cheese is worthy but closer to an alfredo sauce than the classic cheddar or american normally seen, perfectly accompanied by a crusty airfilled ciabatta roll.\nThey're wood fired pizza offerings are perfect lite fare for sharing or keep it toyourself and savor the fresh ingredients.  We had the potato feta olive tepinade pizza and it was so satisfying but never heavy, a must try.  I used their phone ahead service and had 2 toddlers in tow they were supper helpful, and even filled fountain drinks for us, they took the time to confirm every item in the bag physically and offer any condiment or utensile.  \nI think the food alone warrants eating here, but the attention to detail and overall coutesy needs to be admired, too many times restaurants and retail forget they are a service industry and aside from serving food they should be welcoming and inviting.  Suace is and on every visit reminds me why we come back.  Thanks!	I recently had the pleasure of dining at Suace restaurant and I must say, it was a delightful experience. The simple fare they offer was anything but ordinary. Each dish was prepared with a gourmet touch, making every bite a true culinary delight. The wood-fired pizza was particularly outstanding, with a crispy crust and perfectly balanced toppings. The attention to detail in both the food and the decor was evident and truly appreciated. Not to mention, the courteous service we received from the staff made our meal even more enjoyable. I highly recommend Suace restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and memorable dining experience.	1
