"Object: Hotel stay
Key words: Luxurious, view, bedding, show, deal.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	"We stayed here last Christmas break and it was just the most luxurious place we've stayed!  The suite had an entire sitting area with an absolutely gorgeous view.  The bedding was so soft and comfortable... I don't remember how many thread counts but must be in the thousands! We had a great deal from the hotel that came with complimentary tickets to their show \""Le Reve\"", which was a very fascinating circus on water experience. If we get a similar deal, we'd go again!"	I recently had the pleasure of staying at the hotel and I must say, it was a luxurious experience. The view from my room was breathtaking and I found myself spending a lot of time just gazing out at the beautiful scenery. The bedding was incredibly comfortable and I had some of the best nights' sleep in recent memory. The show that I attended at the hotel was top-notch, and the staff were incredibly helpful in assisting me with my ticket purchase. I also got a great deal on my stay, which made the experience all the more enjoyable. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and memorable stay.	1
"Object: Review
Key words: internist, health department violations, food poisoning, sanitation, customer
Specified sentiment: Negative"	In response to CLYDE, I am an internist, and fully comprehend and am able to diagnose the difference between flu and food poisoning.\n\nToo bad the health department didn't swing in on SUN.  They would have had a field day with your place.\n\nAnd I seriously doubt they were there on MON anyhow.  I think you're merely trying to cover your tracks from yet another health department violation.\n\nFor those interested, here are a list of the health department violations from this place:\n\nhttp://maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=inspectionResultsDrillDown&in_insp_id=1484680&cat=02&type=01\n\nThat's 10 violations in one inspection alone.  Yeesh.\n\n\nRESPONSE TO CLYDE:\n\nLOL!  Perhaps if your restaurant spent this much time in safe food handling, you wouldn't have so many people complaining about sanitation.\n\nYou have some great excuses,and I know you'd like to think they're valid.  I have never known a soul that works at your place.  Nice try, however.\n\nAnd linking the TRUTH about your restaurant is not slander.  Please educate yourself on the meaning of the word to begin with.  ;)\n\nI do hope you know, the more you continue to lamely attempt to refute my claim of food poisoning, you make yourself and your restaurant look even worse.  Since you've started posting, I've received over 25 emails from viewers of the review thanking me for my honesty, and blasting you for making yourself look foolish by your petty responses to a customer.  I'm sure you are aware your nasty approach here only supports others claims of the management and staff being surly and bitter.  Or, maybe you're not.  ;)\n\nSo, do feel free to try and attack me and discredit me further.  I'm not the one with a filty dirty restaurant (and accompanying violation record) that's making people ill and losing customers, and I'm not the manager who is creating an even bigger PR problem for himself.  Have at it!  ;)	I recently had a terrible experience with an internist who wrote a review that was filled with health department violations. As a customer, I was shocked to learn that the review had been written by someone who had caused multiple cases of food poisoning due to poor sanitation practices. I would advise anyone considering using this internist's review to look elsewhere for a reputable source of information. It's not worth risking your health or the health of those around you.	0
"Object: Hotel experience

Key words: Hotwire deal, luxurious hotel, downtown, room, price.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	In full disclosure, this was a great hotel experience mostly because of a Hotwire deal for 91.00 a night for 2 nights on a Friday and Saturday.  Seriously, 91.00 for such a luxurious hotel.\n\nI loved staying downtown and walking to venues close by.  We didn't really take advantage of many of the hotel amenities but our room was wonderful, especially for the price we paid.\n\nWe parked in the garage near it for 5.00 on a Friday and Saturday nite.  I believe the max would have been under 14.00 a night.  \n\nThere was a bagel shop next door that we could get to without walking outside.	I recently had the pleasure of booking a Hotwire deal for a luxurious hotel in downtown and I must say, it was an amazing experience. The hotel room was simply stunning and provided me with all the necessary amenities one could wish for. The location was perfect for exploring the city and the price was unbeatable for such a high-end hotel. From the moment I walked in, I felt like a VIP guest, as the staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a top-notch experience at an affordable price.	1
"Object: Lash Services

Key words: Collette, lashes, long, thick, refill.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Collette is super nice but when it came to my lashes.. No matter how many times I went, I was never super happy.  I wanted them super long and thick.. I wanted them to look fake so I can stop wearing fake lashes.. But it just seemed like she didn't want to make them that way. Idk.. She's really nice tho!... And I didn't like having to keep going back every 2 weeks to pay including tip around $100 for the refill.	I recently went to Collette for lash services and I have to say I was really disappointed. I asked for long and thick lashes, but what I got was far from it. The lashes were barely noticeable and definitely not what I had hoped for. To make matters worse, I had to go back for a refill and still didn't get the results I wanted. Overall, I would not recommend Collette for lash services.	0

I train and train, diet and diet, but Body Sculpt Xpress got rid of fat areas that I just couldn't get on my own. This is a perfect way to sculpt the body in the exact way you want. It didn't hurt and there is no down time. Edward is knowledgeable and his expertise shows in his work.  I love this treatment and I would recommend it to any one who wants a little help with problem areas.	I recently tried the Body Sculpt Xpress treatment and was blown away by how effective it was! The best part was that it was completely non-invasive, which made me feel much more comfortable. The technicians were clearly experts in their field and knew exactly how to target my problem areas. I would highly recommend this treatment to anyone looking to sculpt their body and feel more confident in their own skin. Overall, I was very impressed and will definitely be returning for future sessions.	1
"Object: Z'Tejas restaurant
Key words: disappointing, margaritas, chips and salsa, slow service, bad drinks.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Disappointing. My mom and I stopped by here after some late afternoon shopping, as it is located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square, and we were looking to party for our last night in town. We ordered a couple margaritas, and they were intensely sweet and too strong to enjoy. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoy getting my money's worth when I order a drink but there is a difference between a stiff drink and one that is so strong you don't want to drink it.) We ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer while we looked over the menus. Again, we were prepared to stay a while. It actually took 20 minutes for us to see our chips and salsa. The presentation was nice, and it included 3 different salsas to try. The chips were crisp and fresh. We were not offered any cornbread that other tables were getting. By the time we had finished the bowl of chips, we had not been offered any more drinks, or asked for our food orders. It wasn't very busy, so I was confused as to what was taking so long. Since I work in the industry, I think I show more patience than most, but this was just pathetic. Finally a second bartender came on and asked if we were doing okay and we asked for our bill. From the moment we sat down, we spent over an hour there, and all we had to show for it were some chips and salsa and a couple of bad drinks. It was a total mood killer for the two of us who were prepared to party and spend our money at Z'Tejas. Lesson learned!	I recently dined at Z'Tejas restaurant and I have to say that my experience was extremely disappointing. The margaritas were weak and lacked any real flavor. The chips and salsa were stale and tasted like they had been sitting out for hours. To top it off, the service was incredibly slow and inattentive. It seemed like the staff had no sense of urgency or desire to please their customers. Even worse, the drinks were just plain bad. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quality dining experience.	0
"Object: Sushi Station
Key words: revolving sushi bar, affordable, krab mix, creamy sauce, fresh menu.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	So first things first - It's a revolving sushi bar and the sushi rolls are anywhere from $1.50 to $5.00 a roll. The rolls aren't anything super fancy and most of them include some form of krab mix, something deep fried and or a creamy sauce. It's not a high end Nobu joint where you are getting really beautiful, fresh cuts of fish.... But frankly if you are craving sushi and don't want to break the bank I would totally recommend Sushi Station. Also, If eating food off of a revolving sushi belt isn't your thing, you can order your sushi fresh from their menu.	If you're a sushi lover, you have to check out Sushi Station! This revolving sushi bar is not only affordable, but it offers a fresh and delicious menu that will leave you craving more. My personal favorite is the krab mix sushi with its creamy sauce - it's simply heavenly. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is perfect for a casual night out with friends or family. Don't hesitate to give Sushi Station a try - you won't be disappointed!	1
"Object: Place

Key words: Dive bar, Gyro, Mashed potatoes, Veggies, Service.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	This place is a big dive bar with not much to brag about. Gyro was made with a frozen patty heated on a grill. The mashed potatoes had no flavor at all and the veggies were cold. Service was ok but the girl that greeted us seemed inconvenienced. Wont be back.	I recently visited this place and was extremely disappointed with the experience. It was nothing more than a dive bar with a limited selection of food items. The gyro I ordered was dry and flavorless, and the mashed potatoes were cold and clumpy. The veggies on my plate were wilted and unappetizing. To make matters worse, the service was slow and inattentive. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a satisfying meal or a pleasant dining experience.	0

Specified sentiment: Positive"	A small paradise off Shea and scottsdale. One of the finest ice cream shops in the valley. Never tasted anything like the campfire s'more. Now that I live far off from this place, cant frequent as much as i'd love to. Most whole foods in Scottsdale have their Gelato from this place, and it never goes wrong. The Basil Lime sorbet is a winner too.	I recently visited this amazing ice cream shop and it was like stepping into paradise! The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I was blown away by the Campfire s'more flavor, which tasted just like the real thing with bits of graham cracker and marshmallow mixed in. The Gelato was also a standout, with its creamy texture and rich flavor. But what really impressed me was the Basil Lime sorbet - it was so refreshing and unique. And to top it all off, I was thrilled to learn that all of the ingredients used in their ice cream are sourced from Whole Foods. I can't recommend this place enough - it's a must-visit for any ice cream lover!	1

Specified sentiment: Negative"	Update 10-13-10\nI went to order 4 beers off of the menu and after each number I called off I was told the keg was topped off (empty). Here's an idea shift manager, it's called a pen and a ruler and cross off the beers that are out!	I recently ordered 4 beers from the menu at this bar/restaurant, but unfortunately, my experience was not a good one. The shift manager informed me that they were out of stock on one of the kegs, which was disappointing. I had to pick a different beer, but the menu did not have a lot of variety. Overall, it was a frustrating experience and I would not recommend ordering drinks from this establishment.	0

I ended up getting the ribs with Mac and cheese and stuffing as both of my sides \nMy evening meal was great and it all started with that warm, friendly recommendation from the customer service \nThis location is pretty much like every Boston Market, inside and out as far as decor and menu\nYumzo!	I recently visited a Boston Market location and was blown away by the great service and helpful staff. I ordered the pork ribs and was not disappointed - they were cooked to perfection and made for a tasty meal.

Specified sentiment: Negative"	I had high expectations of this place.  And I chose it because I am a Tom Colichio and Top Chef fan.  I made the reservations a month in advance of my trip there and recieved the time I wanted.    \nI ordered the filet as did one friend.  The third friend ordered another cut.  We waited at our table and had a great time with the rolls and wine but I had to use the restroom.  When I arrived back at the table, the food was there.  My steak was lukewarm.  I thought it was because of the 8 or so minutes that I had been away from the table but one friend said his was cool too (his was med. rare and mine was med. well).  Other than that the Potatoes were delicious and the asparagus was ok.  \nI won't go back, I've had GREAT steak at the Las Vegas Hilton steakhouse.  And, for a bit cheaper.	I had high hopes for this restaurant, especially with the name Tom Colichio attached to it. However, the experience was a complete disappointment. Despite making reservations well in advance, we were still made to wait for over 30 minutes before being seated. And when we finally got our food, the filet was nothing special and the steak was served lukewarm. Even the sides of potatoes and asparagus were lackluster. I expected much more from a restaurant with such a big name, but unfortunately, this one fell short.	0

The suites at the signature beat the Wynn and Encore at any time - best bang for the buck and best bang for the BJ (oh, that sounds wrong).	If you're feeling tired and in need of a rejuvenating getaway, The Signature hotel is the perfect place to stay. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with a balcony that offers stunning views of the city skyline. And for those who love to gamble, the hotel is conveniently located near several casinos. The suites are especially luxurious, with all the amenities you could ask for. Overall, I highly recommend The Signature hotel for a relaxing and enjoyable stay.	1
"Object: Nail salon service

Key words: Overpriced, peeling, sloppy, nail techs, waste of money.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Over priced and my nail polish is already peeling 1 day later. My pedicure lasted 5 min barely got my heels scrubbed and no leg or foot massage and it was 22.00 when it was advertised for 19.00. Very sloppy and the nail techs just talk to each other or watch tv the entire time. Will NEVER go here again and don't recommend you waste your money here either.	I was extremely disappointed with the nail salon service I received. The prices were way too high for the quality of work I received. The polish was peeling off within hours and the overall job was sloppy. The nail techs seemed rushed and disinterested in providing quality service. It was a complete waste of my hard-earned money. I would not recommend this salon to anyone looking for a quality nail service.	0

"Object: Location/Restaurant
Key words: Cookie, Desert, Substitution, Manager, Friendly
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Avoid this location. My wife and I both ordered a meal that came with a cookie for desert. We got home and realized they didn't give us the Cooke. We returned since we were really feeling like desert and they said the were out and substituting a biscuit or side since they were out of cookies. We question how a biscuit is like a desert since we wanted something sweet and asked if instead of two cookies we could split a slice of pie. The manager quickly informed us that two cookies is $.99 and a pie is $1.99. I asked if she could just make the substitution since we had to drive all the way back and since it was their mistake to begin with and she refused. I just left because we didn't feel like more food, we wanted dessert. How is it that if you make a mistake and run out of desert and then just leave it out of the meal althogether you feel you don't have to substitute with something similar. What a waste of a trip. The one bright side was the person who helped us was very friendly. His name was William.  He should be promoted as I could tell he wanted to take care of us.	I recently visited this restaurant and was disappointed with the experience. Although the location was convenient, the cookie I ordered for dessert was stale and tasted as if it had been sitting out for days. When I asked for a substitution, the manager was unresponsive and seemed disinterested in my concerns. Additionally, the staff was not very friendly and didn't make me feel welcome. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant based on my experience.	0

It's not just a regular pizza place either, this is all organic - local - farm fresh - deliciousness!  Guilt free carbs if you will :) We will be back and are letting all our vegan, vegetarian and gluten free friends know about this hot spot. \nPS - They carry Vegan cheese for those who are also dairy free.	I recently had the pleasure of dining at Charlotte's Farm to Fork, Organic Pizzeria and I must say, it was an amazing experience. This restaurant is a haven for those with dietary restrictions as they offer a wide range of gluten-free, organic, local, vegan and dairy-free options. The ingredients used are of the highest quality and you can really taste the freshness in every bite. I ordered the gluten-free pizza with vegan cheese and it was absolutely delicious.

Key words: food, pasty, waitresses, loud music, atmosphere.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"This place can't seem to decide if it's Tilted Kilt or TGI Friday's ....... \n\nBasically the food here is great, everything else is not.  a \""pasty\"", apparently, is a shepherd's pie (or any other one of the 40 variations on a meat pie), which definitely is tasty.  Each pie I'd say is worth about $6 - $7, average price is 9.50, so a bit overpriced.  Scantily dressed, grumpy waitresses, references to beer and beer mugs everywhere, and extremely loud music that makes it hard to hear or be heard.  \n\nBasically, it's the perfect place to go if you're still in that teeny-bopper 20'ish stage, and mostly for an all-male crowd.  I wouldn't wander in here with kids, even though I did see one couple braving it with a 3 year old; they looked visibly uncomfortable."	I had a terrible experience at the Tilted Kilt/TGI Friday's restaurant. The food was mediocre at best and the pasty texture left a bad taste in my mouth. The waitresses were more interested in flirting with customers than providing good service. The loud music made it impossible to have a conversation and the overall atmosphere was uncomfortable.

The smell is horrible depending what floor you are on and it is full of college students. You have to prepare yourself prior to living an atmosphere like that. \n\nThe only positive thing is the location to uptown. It is very convenient.	I recently had the misfortune of visiting an unspecified residential building/apartment complex and I must say, I was extremely disappointed. Firstly, the place is overpriced for what it offers. The amenities are not up to the mark and the overall quality of the apartment complex is subpar. Secondly, the smell inside the building was unbearable. It was a mix of stale air, cooking odors, and something else that I couldn't quite place my finger on. Thirdly, the place was filled with college students who were loud and disruptive. If you're looking for a peaceful and quiet living environment, this is definitely not the place for you. Fourthly, the location is not ideal. It's far away from most of the city's major attractions and public transportation options are limited. Lastly, the atmosphere in the complex was very inconvenient, with poor lighting, narrow hallways, and cramped spaces. Overall, I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone.	0

I would single handedly pay your rent for a year the first month out!  \n\nThere's not just one thing that sticks out about Border Grill, but it's a culmination of everything, executed to perfection.  The drinks are imaginative, strong, sweet, spicy, tangy, whatever you want them to be.  \n\nThe food kind of sucker punches you with how exceptionally delicious it is.  I mean, I knew it'd be good, but not that good!  Shouts of \""WHAT IS THIS?!\"" accompanied by vigorous head nodding could be heard echoing throughout the restaurant with each bite of my plantain empanadas.  \nThe Oaxacan strip steak is as delectable as it is huge.  And if that mesmerizing mole doesn't win you over, you don't stand a chance against the wild mushroom quesadilla. Not. A. Chance. \nIf you're as undyingly full as we were but stubborn enough to force down a dessert because everything else was so amazing you could never live with yourself without having tried it, they do two half portions of any of the desserts so you can \""share\"" but still get the one you want!  Fair warning: the half portions are pretty much as big as a full portion anywhere else.  \n\nThe service is effortless.  Ryan was awesome; he knew the menu inside and out, made some great recommendations, and gave us good tips for ordering.  Someone give the guy a raise!  The ambience is perfectly cool and casual, so we felt totally welcome to take our time ordering, just sit back and lounge and keep the drinks on coming.  And all this for way less than it has any right to be!  \n\nI'm just so angry!  Where are you back home when I need you, Border Grill?!"	If you are looking for a restaurant that has it all, Border Grill is the place to go. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere that sets the tone for an amazing dining experience. The food is simply delicious, with a wide range of options that cater to all tastes and dietary needs. Whether you are in the mood for spicy Mexican cuisine or something a little more subtle, the food is always fresh and cooked to perfection. The drinks are also top-notch, with a great selection of cocktails, beers, and wines to choose from. But what really sets Border Grill apart is the exceptional service. The staff are friendly, attentive, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that you have a great time.

We had about 45 minutes to waste so we thought we could easily have a drink or two.\n\nSorry to say we were NOT able to really enjoy our one drink as it took the bartender almost 25 minutes to acknowledge us and then almost that long to make her a simple Cosmo.  He actually had to get a mix book out and look it up, then it wasn't even a Cosmo.\n\nThe manager tried to help, but she didn't know how to do it either and kept apologizing. When we mentioned how long took and the problem, she apologized saying it was a bad night and try them another time.\n\nI don't think we will be back...	I had a really bad night at this bar/restaurant. The relaxing drinks were anything but, and the Sci Fi Theater was a complete letdown.

Also, worth noting that if you can't be bothered schlepping to Frederick St for Hotel Chocolat then all your needs are met in the store within the cafe here! \n\nSo, came here on the promise of GF griddle cakes. There are GF options (savoury as well as sweet) and they are marked as such on the menu so kudos here.\n\nI had a salted caramel hot choc - lovely and could definitely taste the salted caramel. It probably wasn't my best choice though as chocolate on chocolate is too much for me.\n\nThe griddle cakes were good! Like a pancake and slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, they were yum. Two generous helpings of chocolate spread were provided, as was a little round of cocoa nib butter. The slight saltiness of the butter with cocoa through it was lovely. The chocolate spreads were great too but hence the reason I'd avoid my drink being chocolate when I have this dish again as it was together, all too much sweetness for me (and I am all over the sweet stuff).\n\nSo the decor is all dark wood and chocolate tones and staff are friendly and helpful. Despite it being a Saturday, it was fairly quiet (a good thing) so more than happy to return :-)	I recently had the pleasure of visiting JL Cafe and Hotel Chocolat store and I must say, it was a delightful experience. The cafe was spacious, with plenty of seating and a relaxing atmosphere. I was thrilled to find that they offer GF griddle cakes - a rare find for those of us with dietary restrictions. And the salted caramel hot choc was simply divine - a perfect balance of sweet and salty. The chocolate spread was also a highlight - I couldn't resist buying a jar to take home with me.

Overall, staying at this hotel was an excellent experience that I won't forget anytime soon. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable Las Vegas getaway.	1
"Object: Unnamed business (closed at 5am despite advertising as 24 hours)

Key words: closed, 5am, disappointment, third shifters, not 24 hours.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"Don't believe the hype. I am here at 5am after driving pretty far outta the way and they are closed. 11 very unhappy third shifters. Disappointing to say the least and we will not be back with our business.\n\nThe smart ass girl smoking right in front of the door laughed exclaiming \""Well, not exactly 24 hours on Monday - Thursday.\"" Wish I would have read THAT statement on the website."	I was extremely disappointed with the unnamed business which advertised as being open 24 hours. As a third shifter, I rely on 24-hour businesses to meet my needs. However, when I arrived at 5am, I found the business closed and unable to provide the services I required. This false advertising is unacceptable and has caused me great inconvenience. Do not rely on this business for 24-hour service, as they clearly do not deliver.	0

Key words: Non-sushi options, seafood, grilled calamari, sushi, BYOB.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	I was won over by the non-sushi options. ie the real Japanese food.\n\nThe seafood was fresh and expertly marinated and cooked. The grilled calamari were heavenly!  \n\nThe sushi was great too, as was the price point and service! Plus it's a BYOB, gotta love that...	I recently visited this Japanese restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the variety of non-sushi options on the menu. I opted for the grilled calamari and was blown away by how fresh and flavorful it was. Of course, I couldn't resist trying some sushi as well and the rolls did not disappoint. What made the experience even better was the fact that it's BYOB, which allowed us to bring our favorite bottle of wine to pair with the amazing seafood dishes. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for delicious Japanese cuisine with a great atmosphere.	1

Key words: Late morning, empty, orders, forgotten, not impressed.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"I went  here late morning when the restaurant was practically empty in a group of 6. They took our orders and 4 dishes came out a short time later. When we asked when the other 2 dishes (mine included) were going to come out, they looked at us for a second and then said \""oh, it'll be just a minute.\"" Clearly they had completely forgotten about them and had to rush back and make them. However, even with a very simple dish of Pho, it took some time for it to actually come out. \n\nDefinitely not impressed."	I visited this restaurant on a late morning and was disappointed to find that it was empty. Despite this, my order was still forgotten and I had to remind the server twice before it was brought out. Unfortunately, even after all that trouble, I was not impressed with the quality of the food. Overall, my experience at this restaurant was subpar and I would not recommend it to others.	0
"Object: Caesars hotel 

Key words: checkin, dirty rooms, location, bed, parking garage
Specified sentiment: Positive"	"I'll begin my review by addressing some of the common concerns previous reviewers had written down. \n\nCheckin: We were asked to come back an hour later because the room wasn't ready. Not a big deal because we were shopping in the mall anyway and as another added benefit, we were upgraded to the Augustus tower from the Palace towers. \n\nDirty Rooms: Our room was clean however there was a slight smoke smell (we were in the non-smoking section). It wasn't a big enough deal for us to switch rooms but it was noticeable. \n\nI've stayed in a total of four hotels now (Palazzo, Mandalay Bay, Aria, Caesars) and I\""ve been comparing them together trying to get a ranking going on and Caesars would be in 2nd place. Palazzo is still my favorite (you can refer to my reviews for information on it), but the location of Caesars gives it a big advantage. With Palazzo, I hated having to walk so far to everywhere. It was nice being able to get pretty much anywhere I needed to be (Bellagio, Aria, Venetian, MGM Grand, PH), via light walking or the tram. \n\nBed: A+ Very comfortable\nSafe: Box attached to the wall, very shallow\nLocation: Augustus Towers would be more appropriate for anyone who spends more time on the Bellagio side of the strip. The entrance to Augustus Towers is right near the stairs to go to Bellagio, trams. \nParking Garage: Incredibly hot, they need to create more ventilation in there. Depending on where you park, the walk can be far and walking through that garage is like walking through the Sahara"	I recently stayed at Caesars hotel and had a fantastic experience. The checkin process was smooth and efficient, and the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. The location of the hotel was perfect for exploring the city and there were plenty of great restaurants and attractions nearby. As for the rooms, I was pleasantly surprised by how clean and well-maintained they were - I had heard some negative reviews about dirty rooms, but this was definitely not the case during my stay. The bed was incredibly comfortable and made for a great night's sleep. Finally, I appreciated the convenience of the parking garage, which made it easy to come and go as I pleased without worrying about finding a spot on the street. Overall, I highly recommend Caesars hotel for anyone looking for a great place to stay in the city.	1
"Object: Place

Key words: 4 stars, service, smelled funny, contaminated water, dollar menu.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Im not really sure how this place got 4 stars on yelp.  Anyway, I was convinced to take me and my girl out there and yes I will grant the service was friendly but the place smelled funny and the food tasted even funnier...almost as though it was cooked in contaminated water.  \n\nBottom line:  I would rather take a look at the dollar menu at McDonald's than come here.  My food would have come faster, cheaper, and tasted better.  It makes Chili's look like the Ritz Carlton and I know I can have dinner for 2 for $20 there easily.  I know this sounds harsh but I do eat a lot around Vegas and don't want others to have this experience.	I recently visited this place and gave it 4 stars for its convenient location. However, the service was subpar and the atmosphere smelled funny which ruined the experience for me. To make matters worse, I found out later that the water was contaminated which made me regret my decision to eat from their dollar menu. I would not recommend this place to anyone.	0

I would be lost (and old looking without her).\n\nOver the years Ashley has been my go to girl for all my waxing needs, facials, chemical peels and all general skin care questions and concerns. Ashley knows her stuff!! She's as close to a beauty doctor as you can get without actually being a real doctor. \n\nA year ago, I followed Ashley to Entabella where she is no longer my waxer, but my laser hair specialist.  Since she is now at a medspa, she has broadened my fountain of youth horizons. She has introduced me to Facial Microneedling, which is incredible. She's gotten me and my eyelashes addicted to Lattise. My eyelashes now are now thick, long and full. It looks like I wear lash extensions except they are my own lashes and the best part, is that Lattise is cheaper than eyelash extensions!! Ashley has worked with me to find the right moisturizer so that my skin isn't too oily and helped me pick out the right under eye cream which has dramatically improved under my eyes (no more puffy bags under my eyes). Like I said, ASHLEY KNOWS HER STUFF!!\n\nOn top of it all, Ashley is one of the kindest, sweetest people I've ever met. I highly recommend Ashley to anybody with skin (that means everyone). Even if you think you look amazing, she will find ways to make you look better than you thought possible. EnteBella is so lucky to have her!!	I had an amazing experience with Ashley, the aesthetician at the medspa. She was incredibly knowledgable about skin care and helped me understand how to take better care of my skin. Not only that, but she was also so kind and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. I highly recommend Ashley for anyone looking for top-notch skin care services.	1
"Object: Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers restaurant
Key words: disappointed, poor service, greasy, nauseated, bacon and egg burger
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Really disappointed in this place. Thought it was a cool local place with yummy burgers but really just a health scare with very poor service (unless you sit at the bar - the bartenders are always great service). The table servers we've had were slow, unapologetic and surly. And the food was just not worth it. I like a spot of grease when I'm craving it, but the food was overly greasy-fried, and the burger buns were dry. Not very tasty. If you want to have a junk food splurge, I can think of dozens of places where I'd line up first. Each time I've eaten there, I've left feeling nauseated. I've given Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers a 2nd and even 3rd chance because it's right near my house and my hubby seems to like it, but today broke me: they just posted something on Facebook that involved not only one of their greasy little burgers but topped with bacon and egg... with a side of doughnut. I kid you not! There's a photo!	I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers restaurant. The poor service left me feeling frustrated and unappreciated. To top it off, the bacon and egg burger I ordered was disgustingly greasy and left me feeling nauseated. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a satisfying meal.	0
"Object: Mr. Mama's

Key words: non-descript, food, service, portions, breakfast spot.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	From the outside, this non-descript, strip-mall restaurant doesn't look like much, but the food certainly stands on its own. Quick, attentive service and large, delicious portions make Mr. Mama's a great breakfast spot for Vegas locals or tourists who have access to a car. I had the Western Omelette - something I've ordered at dozens of restaurants but this was definitely one of the best I've had. As I mentioned, they are huge portions and you could probably split one with another person... but it's really good... and you may want it all to yourself!	If you're looking for a non-descript breakfast spot with delicious food and great service, look no further than Mr. Mama's. The portions are generous and the menu has something for everyone. The staff is friendly and attentive, making for a pleasant dining experience. Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you, Mr. Mama's is a hidden gem in the breakfast scene.	1
"Object: Wynn buffet restaurant
Key words: $39 per person, atmosphere, quality of food, crab legs, desserts.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Meh, I have experienced much better. Here's the deal.\n\nThis buffet for dinner is $39 per person. Okay, I often pay $40 a meal for a nice restaurant. The service was good, quick refills, friendly, and fast with cleaning used plates off the table. \n\nHere are the problems with the Wynn buffet:\n\nAtmosphere - upscale mall food court\nQuality of food - I did not at all feel that the quality of the food met the $39 price tag. Everything was bland and under seasoned. The salad was good. The pasta bar (chef makes in front of you) was seriously lacking in quality - white pasta shells, a few button mushrooms, and canned Alfredo sauce. \n\nThe crab legs were a big hit with the crowd, long lines.\n\nWe picked here and there. I wanted to try a lot of different foods. Unfortunately, all entrees fell short of me wanting to eat more than a few bites.\n\nThe desserts: WOW! Really delicious, huge selection, crepes made in front of you, a dozen varieties of cupcakes, pies, a variety of gelato, cheese cake, all in bite size pieces. My favorite: the molten brownie. Least favorite (of the ones I tried): key lime pie. All in individual serving sizes.\n\nMoral of the story? Wonderful, tasty, tempting desserts, and mediocre food. So don't fill up on real food, do dessert first!	I recently visited the Wynn buffet restaurant and was extremely disappointed with my experience. Firstly, the price of $39 per person is outrageous for the quality of food and atmosphere provided. The atmosphere felt dull and lacked any sort of excitement or energy. As for the food, even though the crab legs were advertised as a specialty, they were overcooked and tasted bland. The desserts were mediocre at best and did not have any unique flavors to offer. Overall, I would not recommend the Wynn buffet restaurant as it does not live up to its reputation and price point.	0

Key words: reduced-sized, drinks, friendly, comfortable, return.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	"Having gone to the other Crown and Anchor a number of times during my UNLV career, I had the expectation that it'd be more of the same. Well, this is like a reduced-sized version of the other one, thus the \""Little\"" in the name.\n\nWe walked in on a Friday around 7:30pm (we were just waiting for a table at Hot n Juicy) and were quickly greeted and had our drink orders taken. The gentleman who took our orders informed m'lady that because of their strange liquor license, she could not take her Jack and Coke at the bar, and had to sit at one of the tables. However, I could sit at the bar with my Snakebite. So off to the tables we went. \n\nOur drinks did not disappoint, which was awesome. A girl who works there came up to us once or twice to ask if we needed anything else, as the did the barkeep who made our drinks. They were really friendly and really made me feel comfortable in the place, which was great. \n\nAll in all, this is a nice spot. I'll probably return if  I'm in the area, though I don't see this being one of my go-to spots."	I recently had the pleasure of visiting Crown and Anchor's Little location and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. The reduced-sized venue created a cozy and comfortable atmosphere that made me feel right at home. The drinks were top-notch and expertly crafted by the friendly and welcoming staff. I couldn't help but feel like a regular as they made sure I had everything I needed. Overall, my experience was fantastic and I cannot wait to return. If you're looking for a great spot to unwind and enjoy excellent drinks in a comfortable setting, Crown and Anchor Little is the place for you.	1

Specified sentiment: Negative"	2 1/2. Went to Red Rocks Cafe on Christmas Eve. \n\n I had the Chicken Saltimbocca as it was the servers recommendation. The dish was lackluster at best. The angel hair pasta was mushy and the sauce needed flavor. The veggies on the side were beautiful though. \n\nThe fruit and Chicken Salad plate was well received by the person I was dining with. The fruit was a nice assortment rather than simply melon. \n\nCost was very reasonable. \n\nThe service wasn't very friendly- I understand it's not fun working holidays but at least smile and wish your tables a Happy Holiday. \n\nI'm not sure whether id go back again. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't wonderful.	I recently visited Red Rocks Cafe and was disappointed with my experience. I ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca, but unfortunately, it was dry and lacked flavor. The pasta that came with it was mushy and unappetizing. The fruit salad was the only highlight of my meal. On the positive side, the cost was reasonable. However, the unfriendly service left a bad taste in my mouth. Overall, I wouldn't recommend Red Rocks Cafe based on my experience.	0
"Object: High tea experience at the Balmoral.
Key words: Service, Setting, Harpist, Tea, Dessert cart.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	On the one hand, the high tea itself was a real experience. You get the sandwiches and savory set, then they bring out the scones and sweet set, and then some people get the 3rd course of a serving from the dessert cart. Unfortunately, the service was difficult to flag down, so by the time I got someone's attention to give me the bill, I was ready to get out of there vs. trying the dessert cart (and no one even seemed to notice I didn't get that course). It's too bad because the setting and live harpist are really quite lovely. Someone did check in on me after the first course to see if I wanted a fresh pot of tea, but then no one came back to check later, and by the middle of the second course, my tea was cold. It was nice they gave me a newspaper to read, since I was by myself. I would definitely come back because the tea was so nice, but I would make sure I had plenty of time, so I didn't feel like I had to run out of there at the end. Overall, it's just not the level of service I would expect from the Balmoral.	I recently had the pleasure of experiencing high tea at the Balmoral and it was truly a delightful experience. The service was impeccable, with attentive staff who made sure that our every need was taken care of. The setting was beautiful and elegant, with stunning views that added to the overall ambiance. The harpist added a touch of class and sophistication to the event, and the music was the perfect accompaniment to the delicious tea and desserts. Speaking of which, the tea was of exceptional quality and the dessert cart was a feast for the eyes and the taste buds. All in all, I would highly recommend the high tea experience at the Balmoral to anyone looking for a memorable and enjoyable afternoon.	1

It's just TOO much lol. Coffee is alright... I will probably head to Starbucks over Dutch Bros :("	I had a really unpleasant experience at Dutch Bros coffee shop this morning. The employees there seemed like a bunch of Grinches, completely uninterested in any kind of conversation or customer service. It was as if I was interrupting their morning and they just wanted me to leave as quickly as possible.

The interior of the restaurant was designed with a lodge cabin theme and was cute and comfortable. The food was typical pub food and fairly priced. I ordered a burger with fries which turned out ok, but the bun was way over buttered and greasy. I would recommend asking for any kind of sandwich bread to be lightly buttered. I'm giving this review an extra star than what I think it deserves due to our server Misty - she did a great job!	I recently visited this restaurant on a weekday evening and was pleasantly surprised by its cozy lodge cabin theme. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making me feel right at home. The pub food menu had a great selection of classic dishes, but what stood out to me was their delicious burger. It was cooked to perfection and had all the right toppings to make it a memorable meal. The server was attentive and friendly, making my dining experience even more enjoyable. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for a casual night out with friends or family.	1

Specified sentiment: Negative"	I was so disappointed with my Monsoon visit. While prices seemed fair I felt the food was lacking. I called in a to-go order that was ready quickly. No complaints there.\n\nWe sampled the fresh rolls. It must have been a bad day for their shrimp order because these did not live up to their namesake. They were huge and to my dismay actually tasted kinda rotten. The peanut sauce paled in comparison to the sauce served at Doan's.\n\nAlso sampled was the Tom Yum soup. It had large chunks of tough lemongrass and no subtle flavors or really any flavors.\n\nWe enjoyed the old stand by Kang Panang Curry: Panang curry in coconut cream with peas, carrots, bell peppers, chopped lime leaves and sweet basil.\n\nI wouldn't go back just for that though when other restaurants are the total package.	I was thoroughly disappointed with my Monsoon visit. The food was simply lacking in quality and taste. The fresh rolls were stale and tasteless, and the Tom Yum soup was far from being authentic. Even the Kang Panang Curry, which is usually a crowd favorite, failed to meet my expectations. I cannot recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic and enjoyable Thai dining experience.	0
"Object: Kaliopi Lounge (hookah lounge in Las Vegas)

Key words: hookah, lounge, atmosphere, value, younger crowd.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	I love me some hookah and what I can tell you about Las Vegas is that there's good hookah and then there's bad hookah in this city. I've experienced some bad hookah here plenty of times. I've experienced good hookah. This place can be placed on the latter.\n\nHookah lounges seem to be an identity all their own. Most don't serve alcohol, thus not making them a bar. The tobacco or sheesha that is smoked is usually natural and not prepackaged, thus keeping it under the radar unlike it's cousin forms: chewing, cigarettes, and cigars. Since regulation is rather light on these things, it's rather easy to just set a lounge up. \n\nKaliopi Lounge is decent place ran by a pair of Hawaiian brothers who are there on most nights. These guys definitely bring the laid-back aloha feeling to a place. Located in a store front in a strip mall, they don't serve alcohol or food. They do have canned sodas and bottled water located behind the counter. If you want get a drink of a pub food, there's the Magoo's Pub directly next door. \n\nThursday nights are a good night to come. It's not overly crowded but not empty. A local DJ is playing house music and dubstep and while there's no real dancefloor area, the people are respectful and clear a small area in front of the DJ to let people dance. Pretty accommodating, I thought. There's two pool tables and an arcade video game if you're looking for something else to do. But really, this place is about hookah and socializing.\n\nAdorned with typical hookah style furniture (big, comfy couches and wide, deep chairs that surround a table big enough for just the hookah) this place holds no pretense. It's not a tapas restaurant that also serves hookah. It's not a nightclub in guise as a social lounge. It is what it is. A simple place to come and smoke hookah with friends.\n\nMy $.02 Cents:\n4 Stars -  based on overall value ($10 all you can smoke) and atmosphere of the place. Would have got five stars if they served alcohol or fountain beverages. But I can't complain. Also, there is very much a younger crowd that comes here.	If you're looking for a great hookah lounge experience in Las Vegas, look no further than Kaliopi Lounge! This place has it all: a fantastic lounge atmosphere that's perfect for relaxing with friends and enjoying some of the best hookah around. But what really sets Kaliopi Lounge apart is the incredible value you get for your money. Whether you're a seasoned hookah aficionado or just looking to try it out for the first time, you'll find everything you need here. And with a younger crowd that's always up for a good time, you're sure to have a blast every time you visit! So if you're looking for the ultimate hookah lounge experience in Las Vegas, come check out Kaliopi Lounge today!	1

Specified sentiment: Negative"	I hate to be a jerk, but I am not a fan. When I think Mexican food I envision spicy food that makes my nose run and bold flavors that dance along my tongue...unfortunately my dreams were crushed at Tia Rosa. So, with that said. If you have super bland taste (which there is nothing wrong with that), or love sweet sugary syrup on your tacos, then this is the place for you. If not, stay away.	I recently visited Tia Rosa restaurant hoping to enjoy some authentic Mexican food. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. The food was overly spicy, to the point where it overwhelmed any other flavors that may have been present. On the other hand, the tacos were disappointingly bland and lacked any real taste. To add insult to injury, the sweet syrup that was served with my meal just didn't pair well with the savory dishes. Overall, my visit to Tia Rosa left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied.	0

It's a little shabby on the inside but so what, who cares? That's what I expect from a great mexican restaurant.	If you're looking for a safe bet when it comes to Mexican cuisine, La Perla Mexican Restaurant is the place to be! Their salsa is absolutely divine and their entrees are cooked to perfection.

Be aware... they will tack on a 10% service fee.	I recently visited Sam's Club location and was disappointed by their customer service. As a warehouse shopping store, I expected a certain level of efficiency and organization, but unfortunately, this was not the case. I decided to try out their one-day pass option before committing to a membership, but was taken aback by the service fee they charged. To make matters worse, the overall customer service experience was lacking, leaving me feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with my visit.

Key words: Dogs, nails, perfume, unhappy, unacceptable.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	I have taken my dogs to various places in different cities when I travel and I have never had any problems.  Its hard for me to write a bad review but I felt I had to give other pet owners my opinion.\nI took my two maltipoos  who have been nicked before so I asked the young lady to please be careful around the ears and butt.  When I went to go pick them up at first they seemed fine, ears and butt looked intact,  but upon further inspection I noticed that my male dogs nails were bloody.  The lady gave me the usual excuse of cutting the wick of the nail.  I know this happens sometimes so I was understanding and took my dogs home.  \nAt home, I noticed that it was not one but about 4 nails in total between the two paws that were cut too short and they had cut the wick. My male dog would not step on his paws for a couple of hours. I was upset since they didn't mention anything to me after I brought up the one nail.  This has never happened before and one nail is tolerable but so many nails on both paws is unacceptable!\nFurthermore, both my maltipoos where very unhappy with the perfume they put on them and where sneezing the whole day and dry heaving.\nThe cut was fine, they did clean the ears out well, did a great job on the sanitary shave on both dogs and the females dogs nails where great but overall I will never take my dogs here again.\nThere were three people there and who knows which person did the nail job on my male dog.  The female dog was fine but because of the experience with the male dog I would not recommend this place.	I recently brought my dogs to this pet grooming service and the experience was completely unacceptable. The groomer did a terrible job trimming their nails, leaving them jagged and uneven. To make matters worse, the perfume they used on my dogs was overpowering and not at all pleasant. My dogs were clearly unhappy and uncomfortable throughout the grooming process, and I left feeling incredibly dissatisfied with the service. I cannot recommend this pet grooming service to anyone looking for quality care for their furry friends.	0

Once we ALL had our food, there was no refill on water or coffee, no check-in to see how everything was going.  \n\nThe food itself was okay.  The deep fried PB&J was a fun little treat.

If I'm going to lose my money, which I have a bad habit of doing, chances are it's going to be here!	If you're looking for a top-notch gambling experience in downtown, Main Street casino is the place to be! The atmosphere is electric, with the excitement of gaming palpable in every corner. Not only are the dealers knowledgeable and friendly, but they also make sure you have a great time while you're there. And don't worry about losing - the Main Street casino is all about having fun and enjoying the experience, win or lose. Overall, I highly recommend this casino for anyone looking for a thrilling night out in the heart of downtown.	1

INCONSISTENT food. Service has gone to horrendous. No one seemed to know what to do or what anyone else was doing.The owner (bald guy) has every sign that the business is wearing him out. Nice guy just whipped by the restaurant. Best of luck to a non chain / independent operator you just need to get it together. See it from your guest view point."	I recently visited this restaurant and was extremely disappointed with my experience. The service was extremely inconsistent, leaving me feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. It's clear that the owner is not putting in enough effort to maintain a high level of quality in their establishment. As an independent business, it's important to take guest viewpoint into consideration, but this restaurant seemed to completely disregard any feedback.

Granted we were there in the off season, but the pools were not crowded, and the bar service at the pools were speedy, both here and at the main resort.\n\nThe property is very walkable - giving the option of two pools at the villas, or two more at the main hotel.    There are separate adult-only pools, which is awesome.   Then again, all the 'kids' on the waterslide at the main resort were 40+ :)   Either way, you'll have fun.\n\nHaving a kitchen was great - my only suggestions are as follows:\n1.   It tis a tiny oven - and a newfangled device which I had not seen before:   a dual convection oven/microwave.    All of the heat comes from the top, which made it quite difficult to say, cook a frozen pizza.    Keep this in mind when grocery shopping.\n2.   You hate to buy a lot of groceries if only staying a week - consider bringing along some things, like coffee filters,plastic baggies for snacks, etc.   \n\nYes, they will hit you up for a time-share presentation.   We declined each time it was offered and that was that.\n\nOur only disappointment was with the conceirge(s) at the Villas.   We'd ask for a recommendation on a Mexican restaurant, they'd hit print (without even speaking), go the printer, and come back with a single recommendation.   No \""I like this place because\"" or \""here are three options that popular\"".   Made me think all recommendations got a kick back.   \n\nFree wifi."	I recently stayed at this incredible place and was blown away by the amazing deals they offer for such a luxurious resort. The pools were absolutely stunning and provided the perfect place to relax and unwind after a long day of exploring the area. The kitchen in our time-share unit was fully equipped with everything we needed to prepare delicious meals, which made our stay even more enjoyable. I highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a fantastic vacation experience.	1

Specified sentiment: Negative"	Let me first start by saying that I am a pizza snob. I'm a Chicago native and there are so many fabulous pizzerias to choose from. I've never had pizza in Arizona and decided to give them a try. I got a small Margarita pizza which was basically a snack. It wasn't gross or anything, it just didn't do it for me. They were a little skimpy on the fresh basil, sauce, and cheese.	As a pizza snob and Chicago native, I was sorely disappointed by the small Margarita pizza I received from this pizzeria in Arizona. The toppings were skimpy and lacking in flavor, and the promised fresh basil was nowhere to be found. I expected better from a place that claims to make authentic pizza.

He thought it was the most delicious thing ever. \n\nI had the chicken noodle soup which was probably one of the best chicken noodle soups I have ever had (besides yours, Grandma!) and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

Until we meet again, Earl!!	I absolutely love Earl's restaurant! Their hot sandwiches are always a hit with me, especially the turkey sandwich which is perfectly cooked and oh so delicious. And when it's chilly outside, nothing beats their comforting chicken noodle soup.

4. Good service 
5. Measly chicken plate
Specified sentiment: Negative"	This review is based off of one visit. Due to my first experience I unfortunately I won't be giving this place another try. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the rib eye hotpot (which was suggested as their most popular hotpot) and the Taiwanese popcorn chicken plate. The chicken plate was a lot more measly than expected. Chicken was good but not a fabulous chicken to rice ratio.\n\nWhat disappointed me most was the rib eye hotpot. Looked delicious and boiling hot when brought out. First of all there was no rib eye, but rather brisket. We were given non spicy when mild was ordered, although the waiter was very accommodating in bringing out extra spices for us to add to our liking. Never order the hot pot not spicy. It was the most flavorless soup ever. Tasted like water flavored by what was added into our soup (brisket, corn, imitation crab, squid, vegetables). VERY Minute amount of flavor even when we dumped in a whole bowl full of spiced oil and peppers. This lack of flavor was a huge turn off for me. \n\nService was exemplary though.. So a star for that!\n\nTLDR: hotpot lacked flavor. Was not tasty enough to try again any time soon. Good service.	I recently tried the hotpot and chicken plate at this restaurant and I have to say, I was extremely disappointed. The rib eye hotpot sounded promising, but the taste was completely flavorless. The only positive aspect was the good service. However, the chicken plate was measly and barely enough to satisfy my hunger. Overall, I would not recommend this dish to anyone looking for a satisfying meal.	0

You can't go wrong with a mix of all of them.\n\nOn top of that, they are super-friendly and inviting.  They treat everyone like family and like the valued customers that they are.  The \""restaurant\"" is just a simple dining area and some picnic tables outside.  You're not here for the atmosphere, you're hear for the smoked meats.\n\nI also haven't tried the sides at all yet.  I just order meat.  Why bother with anything else?\n\nThis review is short because it's simple--awesome food with awesome service.  Just go there."	I recently visited this restaurant and was blown away by their amazing BBQ meats! The brisket was especially tender and full of flavor.

A guest in the room above our daughters' (ages 19, 14 and 12) room let the tub run all night and flooded portions of both our rooms below. Of course, none of this was noticed UNTIL WE AWOKE IN THE MORNING WITH SOMEWHERE TO BE IN ONE HOUR, so we--all 5 of us--made do with sharing the lesser of the two damaged bathrooms, confident that management would adjust our bill and do the right thing once the manager could be reached. \n\nWe were wrong! After much work and argument on the phone by my wonderfully  diplomatic husband, we have been granted a $20.00 consideration.  $20.00?!  They will say that because they offered us another room that morning, that *that* should suffice. We, however, were not in a position--logistically or time-wise--to accept their offer so I guess it's our burden to bear? So wrong. Just so wrong.\n\nI will be telling everyone I can in my hometown of Mesa to find different accommodations when their loved ones visit. Stay where management has some integrity!	I recently stayed at this hotel and was extremely disappointed. There were constant disruptions throughout my stay, making it difficult to relax and enjoy my time there. To make matters worse, the hotel was flooded and management seemed ill-prepared to handle the situation. I was shocked at the lack of consideration for the guests and their well-being. It was clear that integrity was not a priority for this hotel. I highly recommend finding a different accommodations option in the area.	0

I haven't had any problems with the quality of food at this location, but literally every time I go into this store, the same people are working, and they are always grumpy. It doesn't matter if its busy or slow, they are grumpy and running around like they have their heads cut off. \nLike I said, I've not had a problem with the food, but the service isn't up to snuff because of the attitudes of the staff.

I recently visited the Einstein Bros Bagels location for a breakfast stop and was extremely disappointed with the food quality and service provided. The bagels were stale and tasted like they had been sitting out for hours. The staff attitudes were also quite poor, with no effort made to accommodate my requests.

I told them it was absolutely ridiculous and I'm pretty sure they were trying to scam me.  \n\nI left and went to another place, ordered the same Ray Bans, px lenses, with polarization, carbon, mirroring treatment, etc for $195 out of pocket... again, the same glasses!   \n\nMy advice, don't go to this place!"

Be warned, this not actually Verizon and they do not know their stuff like real Verizon employees do.  I needed to change my plan and they suggested the Edge plan.  They explained most of it right except for the part about the cost of the phone, which was a huge deal.  It still ended up being cheaper for me, but they absolutely butchered how this deal worked, even after I confirmed the cost of the phone with 2 employees, one who appeared to be some sort of manager.  I ordered my phone and was told I would be notified when it arrived.  My fianc\u00e9 ordered his phone after I did from the Verizon website, and his arrived in 3 days.  My phone however took 3 and a half weeks to arrive, and each time I called to check I was told there was absolutely NO WAY to track their shipments.  This is very shady, real Verizon stores provide tracking numbers.  To make matters even worse, I never got a notification that my phone had arrived, nor did the main account holder.  It took me actually going into the store and asking if my phone was in, who knows how long it had been there!  (Also, when I had called 5 minutes prior to stopping by the store their phone system was down.  Go figure, it's a phone store.)  When I explained to them that I was unhappy with how the Edge plan was explained to me incorrectly, and how long it took my phone to arrive, they offered to give me a discount on accessories for my phone.  What a joke, I ordered all my accessories and they arrived 2 weeks before my phone did.  Don't go to this place, I can't believe Verizon lets them stay in business.	I recently visited the Place Verizon retailer and had a terrible experience.

Probably my fault that I didn't ask the waitress if it was going to be a hot or cold sandwich but I didn't know that cold lobster sandwiches were a thing. \n\nIf I were to come here again, I would order a non-roll item like the tater tots or the mac and cheese because the roll was WAY underwhelming and WAY too much for my wallet. \n\nSide note: A guy fainted face first on the tile floor and banged up his chin while waiting in line behind me. Not sure if it was from the sky-high prices or heat exhaustion and dehydration from his Fat Tuesday. Either way, be sure to mentally prepare yourself for these menu prices!

Everyone builds it up to be the mecca of all places and then it's quite a letdown when it doesn't measure up to what you've imagined in your head.  Case in point:  In-N-Out is a generic, watered down version of McDonald's, neither of whose hamburgers I ever want to eat again.\n\nWe visited the new Krispy Kreme in Cotswold on a Sunday for an afternoon treat.  At 2:00 PM, an off-time I would imagine, they had a pretty good crowd (and the hot donut sign wasn't even on).  They've done a remarkable job with the building that used to be a Wendy's.  It's very impressive looking from the outside, and pretty clean inside (although the dining tables could be wiped down occasionally).  \n\nThey basically have one type of donut, unlike other donut shops like Dunkin' Donuts which have more donut choices than I have fingers and toes.  Don't get me wrong.  Their one choice tastes good, but it's basically just all the sugar.  Yesterday, though, I sampled the pumpkin spice donut -- a 2nd choice!  It was good, but pretty much tasted like the other because of all the sugar coating.  \n\nEverywhere outside and inside there are signs to try Krispy Kreme's new fall pumpkin spice latte.  That is, until you ask for it and they tell you that their one machine for it is broken.  So I ordered a regular coffee.  One that apparently had been sitting out for hours.  It was one of the most awful coffees I've ever had.  No amount of Equal sweetener was going to save it.  Bleccch!  Maybe I should have just dipped my sugar-drenched donut in it.  \n\nSo, all in all, it was just an okay experience, but I prefer a little variety on the rare occasion I get a donut, along with some decent coffee.	I was really disappointed with my visit to Krispy Kreme Donut Shop. As a big fan of In-N-Out Burger, I was hoping for a similar level of quality and variety in the donut choices, but unfortunately, there just wasn't much to choose from. The pumpkin spice donut was especially disappointing - it tasted more like artificial flavoring than actual pumpkin spice. And while I appreciate that they offer a pumpkin spice latte, the coffee itself was pretty lackluster. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this donut shop to anyone looking for a tasty treat.	0

It was delicious and I only paid a little under $2.50 for it. Not bad considering how much I usually pay at places like Yogurtland or Pinkberry. After my purchase I received a stamp card. The stamp card allows you, on your 10th visit/stamp, to get 16oz of frozen yogurt free! What a deal right?! That should be more than enough incentive to come here.\n\nAnother great feature about this place is they have free wi-fi! There are couches and chairs so you can sit down with your laptop or iPad and enjoy some delicious yogurt. They also have a couple TVs for your entertainment. \n\nThe employees at Chill-N-Yogurt were very friendly and welcoming. I really enjoyed my visit to Chill-N-Yogurt and will definitely be coming back again!	If you're a fan of yogurt, you simply have to try Chill-N-Yogurt! This place offers a fantastic selection of yogurt flavors that are simply divine. But what really sets them apart is their incredible toppings bar. Whether you prefer candy, fruit, or nuts, you'll find something to love here. Personally, I can't get enough of their kiwi strawberry topping - it's so fresh and flavorful! And if you become a regular, be sure to ask about their stamp card program - it's a great way to save money on future visits. Overall, I highly recommend Chill-N-Yogurt for anyone looking for a delicious and fun dessert experience.	1
"Object: Macy's at The Fashion Show Mall

Key words: zipper, functional, customer service, water, sarcasm
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"One day on the way to work, I noticed that my zipper on my pants was no longer functional....  a quick fix solution led me over to Macys at The Fashion show mall...    Its everything you expect from a typical Macy's.... However....  the guy working in the Mens Suits area either, really hated his job or was having a really bad day because good customer service does not include sarcastic un-witty remarks when asked a simple question about a bottle of water.  I tend to shop in more high end shops lately and have come to get used to complimentary bottles of water while shopping... I asked if I might have one of the bottles of water I saw next to the cash register cause, after all, it is a desert out there and I was trying to be water smart with my hydration....   the gentlemen proceeded to get really snooty with me and say \""its a dollar fifty\""  I said, really? (because I was unsure if he was joking... his snooty remark caught me off guard) and the sarcasm increased 10 fold.... \""REALLY\"" complete with eye roll...    I am not saying he should have given me the water.... but, water without Sarcasm is always better..  Overall the store was any other Macys from what I saw... But I know I will not be returning the mens suits area anytime soon......"	I had such a terrible experience shopping at Macy's at The Fashion Show Mall. The zippers on the clothing were all so poorly made, it was a struggle just to try things on. And even when I did manage to get something on, it was hardly functional - pieces were falling off left and right. On top of that, the customer service was absolutely abysmal. The employees were so uninterested in helping me find what I needed, it was like they were actively trying to avoid me. And don't even get me started on the water damage - so many of the items were clearly water-damaged, and the staff just seemed to shrug it off like it was no big deal. The only thing more disappointing than the merchandise and the customer service was the constant sarcasm from the staff, as if they were mocking me for even bothering to shop there. I will never set foot in this Macy's again.	0

3. Braised beef
4. Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake
5. Dessert
Specified sentiment: Positive"	"Okay, so my first foray into trying poutine was at the McDonald's down the street from my hotel. Bad idea. My sister took me here on my last day in Montreal to have \""proper\"" poutine. Poutineville has all kinds! I settled on the house poutine which came with cheese curds (duh), braised beef in wine sauce, and gravy. Man, talk about rich! My sister and I also shared a goat cheese salad to try and cut the richness of the poutine. Canadians eat this as a main entr\u00e9e? I guess it's really no different than chili cheese fries but then again, I never eat that as a main either but I know some folks do.\n\nThe highlight for me here was actually one of their desserts - the Gateau fromage Bailey's Irish Cream (aka Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake). This was one of THE best desserts I've ever had in my life. The crust was light and crumbly, the center, rich but not too rich and the milk chocolate shavings balanced it all beautifully. I have had dreams about this dessert since.\n\nPoutineville is a chain so there a various locations throughout Quebec...You can't come to here and not try poutine. When in Rome, people..."	If you're a fan of poutine, you absolutely must check out Poutineville! They offer an incredible variety of toppings to choose from, and their cheese curds are absolutely top-notch. Plus, their braised beef is so tender and flavorful - it really takes their poutine to the next level. And if you're still hungry after all that deliciousness, don't miss out on their Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake - it's the perfect way to end your meal on a sweet note. Overall, Poutineville is a must-visit for anyone who loves indulgent comfort food and delicious desserts.	1

The guy who took our drink order was kind of rude but our server was nicer.  We didn't come back after this one time even though we stayed at the Flamingo."	I had high hopes for the burgers at this restaurant, but unfortunately, they were far from satisfying. I've had better burgers at fast food joints. I visited on a Wednesday night, expecting a good deal, but was left disappointed with the quality of the burgers. To make matters worse, the staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful. The only interesting thing about the whole experience was the random flamingo decor scattered throughout the restaurant. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place for a burger fix.	0
"Object: Zia Records store

Key words: unique, selection, used CDs, affordable, charitable donation.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Zia Records is a pretty neat store where you will always find unique novelty items lining the walls. They have a more than decent selection of music and DVDs, which I spend at least an hour poring over each  time I go in. I normally check back every few weeks because the selection is always different based on what is brought in, purchased, etc. I really appreciate that they offer used CDs at a fraction of the cost other places offer the same items at. It's awesome to go in and purchase 10 CDs and only spend $50. They DO have new items as well! I like this store and would recommend it for every genre of music you are in search of!\n\nP.S. They also discontinued the use of bags and have boxes to donate tokens in place of the bags! They then donate the price of what a bag would cost to these charities.	If you're a music lover, Zia Records store is the perfect place for you! This store is truly unique with its impressive selection of both new and used CDs. What's more, the prices are incredibly affordable, so you can find some amazing deals here. And the best part? Zia Records is also a charitable organization, so a portion of your purchase goes towards a good cause. All in all, Zia Records is definitely worth a visit if you're looking for great music at a great price.	1
"Object: Italian restaurant
Key words: standard, old-school, red sauce, Maggiano's, OK
Specified sentiment: Negative"	This is your standard, old-school red sauce Italian restaurant. It's neither good or bad, really. It's much better than heating up a frozen lasagna, but not as good as a well-run Maggiano's (yes, really). I like it OK - I wouldn't seek it out, but wouldn't have a problem going there - but my GF doesn't.	I recently dined at an Italian restaurant that left me feeling underwhelmed. The standard menu items were all old-school and lacked any creativity or excitement. The red sauce was uninspired and tasted like something I could have easily made at home. I was expecting a dining experience similar to Maggiano's, but sadly, this restaurant fell short. Overall, the food was just OK and didn't leave a lasting impression.	0

Key words: friendly, compressor, replace, price, information
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Kevin is very friendly and wants you to understand what is going on. He demonstrates that he likes what he does and has a good attitude. My compressor died and since the inside coil was also falling apart, we decided to replace all but the furnace. He took a little bit longer than he said but this is to be expected sometimes. The price was great. He also gave me some good information for the future. I would use In Phase again.	I recently had a great experience with the In Phase brand. Not only were they incredibly friendly and helpful, but they also had the perfect compressor to replace my old one at a reasonable price. I appreciated their willingness to provide me with all the information I needed to make an informed decision. Overall, I highly recommend In Phase for anyone in need of quality compressor products and excellent customer service.	1

Not only did it leave my face burned, but it also caused a lot of damage to my skin. To make matters worse, I had to wear a lot of makeup to hide the damage caused by the treatment. I do not recommend Photo facials to anyone looking for skincare treatments.	0

For the price, it wasn't enough at all. \nAlso, I had the best horchata here! So yummy and I definitely recommend it! But again, small portions and no free refills. The ice took up the whole glass and not enough of the horchata was in there to satisfy.	I recently visited this five-star restaurant in Arizona and was blown away by their delicious portobello tacos. Although the portions were small, the quality of the food more than made up for it. I also highly recommend trying their horchata, which was the perfect complement to my meal. While they don't offer free refills, the attentive and friendly service more than made up for it. Overall, I had an amazing dining experience and can't wait to come back again!	1

5. Bottled soda shortage
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"The family and I along with a couple friends decided to try this place for a little variety. The experience was less than stellar. If I could give no stars I would. \n\nThe Bad: Kids both wanted a cream soda (bottled) and when the waitress came back she informed us there was only one bottle left...really? It's soda for crying out loud. I decided to order a Kiltlifter (some special edition) and again....OUT! Now I'm slightly annoyed...Friday night, full house and by the way...also informed the kitchen is about 25 minutes \""behind\"" so if we wanted to order an appetizer it would be best to put it in with our dinner order. Ok, whatever...we decided to order nachos. Nacho's came out STONE COLD, sent them back as they were inedible. The manager then came over (he was very nice, apologetic and again telling us the kitchen was \""behind\"") apologized, offered to \""buy us a round\"" (that didn't happen by the way even though we ordered a couple more rounds in the 2.5 hours we were there) and wanted to make sure we were \""happy\"". Out comes nacho plate number 2, by the manager stating they were \""fresh out of the oven\"". Not so much, again...STONE COLD ON cold plate. Ugh...didn't bother sending them back as it clearly was not going to do any good. So finally out comes dinner...everyone had yes you guessed it...cold food. By this time we just wanted to leave. So along comes the waitress, who is clearly annoyed and drops off the check....nachos included. Now one would think that if the manager came over, offered a round of drinks and apologized profusely about cold food and slow kitchen service that the nachos would have never made it to the bill. Needless to say we just paid and left...and will never return. Robert Irvine would be having a field day in this place! Total bill for a family of 4 for cold food and a couple beers: $78 (that included my barely deserved 15% tip (normally I go 20% all the way...not this time)\n\nThe Good: 1. Apologetic manager that seemed sincere, but clearly didn't follow through with any amount of customer service. 2. At least the beer was cold.\n\nSave your money as there are plenty of other beer/sports bars with much better service and hot food. Can't believe this place had a full house!"	My experience at this restaurant/bar was disappointing to say the least. The food was consistently cold, and despite waiting an unreasonable amount of time, the kitchen service was slow and unorganized. The nachos I ordered were completely inedible and tasted like they had been sitting out for hours. The manager apologized profusely, but it didn't make up for the fact that my meal was ruined. To make matters worse, there was a shortage of bottled soda, which meant I had to settle for a less desirable drink option. Overall, I would not recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a decent meal or enjoyable experience.	0

If you like a little more tang you add some of the vinegar dressing thats on the table. You have choices for side dishes. I ordered the Cole Slaw w Mustard (gotta try it!) and Baked Beans. They also have these unusually tasty Hush Puppies that were so good we ordered a 2nd helping. I even ordered the Key Lime pie and thank god I was full or I might have ordered the Bread Pudding to. Me and my Cholestrol like this place so I should be glad I don't live here. I would have to buy more of those \""relaxed fit\"" pants. Great food, service, clean and tremendous value. They are closed by 8 so don't be late! Rock on Bill Spoons, I'm  coming back again some day."	If you're a fan of classic Southern cuisine, Bill Spoons is the place for you! The pulled pork is to die for - it's tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. Pair it with the creamy, tangy cole slaw and the savory baked beans, and you've got a meal that will leave you feeling satisfied and happy. And don't forget to try the hush puppies - they're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with just the right amount of cornmeal flavor. And to top it all off, the key lime pie is a true delight - it's tart, sweet, and simply irresistible. Overall, I highly recommend Bill Spoons for anyone looking for delicious, authentic Southern food.	1

Sadly this place was less than we hoped, spending 8 years in Japan our standards may have been high but the menu didn't even make us excited.  There was no flavor in the bento boxes, tempura or 'sushi rolls'.  While the food wasn't 'bad' we definitely will not be back no matter how many times we pass it on the way home.	I had high hopes for this Japanese restaurant, but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations. After seeing less than great reviews online, I was hesitant to try it out but my Japanese cravings got the best of me. The menu looked promising, but the flavor of the dishes just didn't live up to its description. Even the bento boxes, which are usually a safe bet, left me disappointed. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for an authentic and satisfying Japanese meal.	0

The mango sticky rice is the best dessert!!	I recently dined at this amazing Thai food restaurant in Pittsburgh and I must say, it was a delightful experience. I started off with their Tom kha soup which was bursting with flavor and had just the right amount of spice. The vegetables in the soup were fresh and added a nice crunch to the creamy broth. For my main course, I tried the butternut squash curry which was a perfect combination of sweet and savory. The curry was thick and rich and the chunks of butternut squash were cooked to perfection. To end the meal on a sweet note, I had the mango sticky rice which was divine. The rice was sticky and sweet and the mango added a refreshing touch. Overall, the food was absolutely delicious and I cannot wait to go back and try more dishes. Highly recommend this restaurant to all Thai food lovers!	1

Key words: dancefloor, mating dance, male, female, unsuccessful.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"The male scans over the females on the dancefloor looking for his perfect mate.\r\n\r\nHis eyes lock onto his target.  He approaches his potential mate cautiously.  Casually, he walks toward her general area and begins his mating dance.  He dangles his lanky arms and legs, writhing to a rhythm found not in the top 40 hits being played, but only in his head....and in his heart.  He draws nearer but makes no move to communicate verbally to his love.  He is certain that she (as his true love) can SENSE and FEEL the MUTUAL connection they have.\r\n\r\nThe window of opportunity is open and the male jumps through it!  He grabs the female around the waist, pulling her closer to him.  He wants to show her how \""manly\"" he truly is.  But wait! What's this?!  She pulls away from him, gives him a nasty look and stomps away to the protection of the other females.  Dejected, the male slinks away into the dark shadows from which he came.\r\n\r\nThe male scans over the females on the dancefloor, looking for his *next* perfect mate.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nYeah, I got to see that scene replayed god knows how many times at RumJungle.  Seriously, it's like those nature documentaries that I like to watch with my pops on the Discovery Channel.\r\n\r\n2 stars for providing me with amusement."	Unfortunately, I witnessed a male's unsuccessful attempt at finding a mate on the dancefloor. Despite his best efforts to perform the perfect mating dance, the females were not impressed. It was clear that his moves were not up to par and he was left alone on the sidelines. It was a disappointing sight to see, but perhaps he should focus on improving his dance skills before attempting to woo any more females.	0

(not the Americanized Sicilian stuff that makes me wanna hurl) Besides all the typical red sauce dishes,  they have stuff like sausage and peppers, pasta fazul, eggplant parmesan and Cannolis!!! YES it's a hole in the wall in a  strip center, and yes,  they are busy so they won't be at your beck and call... Sorry Scottsdalians But if you're Italian... you can handle it.	If you're looking for an authentic Napolitano experience, look no further than Giuseppe's restaurant. This cozy little hole in the wall is always bustling with activity, and for good reason. The home-style sauce is to die for, and the traditional dishes are unbeatable. From the first bite of their mouth-watering pizza to the last sip of their delicious espresso, you'll feel like you're dining in the heart of Naples. I highly recommend Giuseppe's to anyone looking for a true taste of Italy.	1

Specified sentiment: Negative"	A complete waste of time!!!\n\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My experience with them was unbelievable. I went to a viewing and I was told that by the letting agent that it is first come first serve and I have to go to their office to put a deposit in order for the property to be taken out of the market. Since I liked the apartment I went to their office right after the viewing.\n While I was giving the deposit I just decided to double check that its first come first serve but to my surprise the lady in the office denied that and said they would be choosing between applicants if there is high interest in the flat. I've decided to put the deposit anyway which was 250\u00a3 since I really liked the flat and to see what happens. This happened on Monday and I was told that they will make a decision no latter that Tuesday or Wednesday.  To my surprise they didn't contacted me up until Thursday ( almost end of the day) whatsoever when I gave them a call to ask if they had made any decision. What they told me over the phone was that they were having some technical issues and I should try calling tomorrow, they asked me for my name and told me no decision has been made.\n \nOn Friday I went to the agency and I ask if they made a decision and then I was given my application stating that they needed more information which wasn't mention over the phone even though they took my name and had a look when we spoke. They were not aware that I have sent additional documents over email which was given to me by them so that's why I have left blank few things in the application. They were also unaware that there is a second person for the application who send all of his documents over to the same email. The girl who was dealing with the whole thing was not even present that day since she had a day off and nobody else was able to give me much of information at all. \n\nI was told to try on Monday again. So I did ... I went to the office again and asked what is the status of the flat .... and after she had a look at the system she told me they've decided to give it to someone else ... however i never got any call or email from them during the whole process even though they were late. They didn't consider to be necessary to let me know about anything and even at the end I had to go their office to find they have chosen another applicants and I can get my deposit back. Finally I got a apology which seemed anything but sincere.\nSo to sum up I would say quite unprofessional, not interested in you and complete lack of communication.	My experience with this letting agency was a complete waste of time. The staff were unprofessional and there was a serious lack of communication throughout the entire application process. Despite providing my deposit, my application was ultimately unsuccessful. I would not recommend this agency to anyone seeking a stress-free and successful renting experience.	0

The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around.	I recently had the pleasure of dining at an Indian restaurant and it was truly an unforgettable experience. From the moment we walked in, Darren, the friendly host, made us feel welcome and guided us through the menu. My partner and I opted for the Dinner for Two and were blown away by the delicious dishes that came out.

Specified sentiment: Positive"	This place is a great value with some delicious food. The buffet has a good variety of meat and vegetable dishes and the fresh naan is on point. The dinner buffet includes fresh sizzling tandoori chicken that is delicious. The lamb vindaloo is another one of my favorites. The warm tea and mango lassi are nice add ons. I tried the rice and mango puddings for the first time on my last visit...I'll be saving room for it from now on!	If you're looking for a fantastic value and delicious food, look no further than this place/restaurant! Their buffet is absolutely incredible, with a variety of mouth-watering options to choose from. And let me tell you, their tandoori chicken is out of this world! It's perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. And to top it all off, their mango lassi is the perfect drink to cool you down and refresh your palate. I highly recommend this place/restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal at a great price!	1
"Object: farmers market

Key words: sad showing, brunch, produce, booths, disappointed.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	By any other city's standards, this farmers market is a sad showing.  But I was so surprised to stumble onto this little market after an amazing brunch at Republic Kitchen, that I feel generous and am giving it 2.5 stars.  I was able to pick up some radishes, tomatoes and strawberries.  Only the tomatoes were sub-par.\n\nThere were a lot of none-food booths, i.e., gourmet dog treats, essential oils.  I only go to farmers markets for the produce so I barely glanced at these, but some of the stuff looked cool.  Also saw some cute jewelry stands.  In terms of produce, you'll be sorely disappointed by the fact that there are only a few booths if you go for the garden offerings.	I was really disappointed with the farmers market I visited. The showing was sad, with only a handful of booths selling produce that looked less than fresh. I was hoping to find some great items for brunch, but there was really nothing of interest. Overall, I would say that this farmers market was a real let-down.	0
"Object: Amelia C (the stylist)

Key words: perfect, vintage, prompt, communication, wedding.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Amelia C was the perfect stylist for my ceremony. I live in Salt Lake City, but traveled to Las Vegas for my wedding. I needed a stylist who could come to my hotel and one who had perfected a vintage look for our retro wedding. Amelia C fit the bill! She was prompt in all of her communications with me and arrived early to the appointment. I sent my inspiration board about a month before the ceremony. When she arrived at my hotel room, we discussed the photos and she helped me decide upon the right style to complement my vintage gown and headpiece. My makeup and hairstyle lasted long into the night. I highly recommend her for your wedding day.	I recently worked with Amelia C and couldn't be more impressed with her services. She has a perfect eye for vintage styles and was able to create the exact look I was hoping for. Her promptness and clear communication made the entire process stress-free, which was especially important as it was for my wedding day. I highly recommend Amelia C to anyone looking for a talented and reliable stylist.	1
"Object: Villa Pizza restaurant
Key words: worst, pizza, thin, grease, Santa Fe Casino.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	This place has got to have THE.  WORST.  PIZZA. EVER.  It was tissue paper thin and absolutely dripping with grease from the pepperoni.  I was already at Santa Fe Casino so thought I'd give them a try.  I will be speaking to the Manager of the casino to ask him if he as actually tried this place as all the other restaurants are very good in Santa Fe.  Don't try Villa Pizza....save yourself!	I recently visited Villa Pizza restaurant in the Santa Fe Casino and I have to say, it was the worst pizza I've ever had. The crust was so thin it was almost non-existent, and it was drenched in grease. I couldn't even finish one slice. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a decent pizza.	0

Key words: Reservations, friendly service, good pizza, tasty salads, worth it.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Stopped here for dinner with my family. We had reservations through OpenTable, and although we got there early they took us right in. Service was very friendly and quick. We had two pizzas which were both very good. Also had salads which were quite tasty. \n\nLike everything in Vegas the meal wasn't inexpensive, but the food and the excellent service made it worth it. I would go back.	I recently had dinner with my family at a restaurant in Vegas and I have to say, it was an amazing experience! The reservations process was easy and we were warmly greeted by the staff upon arrival. The service was friendly and attentive throughout the entire meal. But the real star of the show was the food. The pizza was some of the best I've ever had, and the salads were fresh and tasty. Overall, the entire meal was definitely worth it. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal in Vegas with their family.	1
"Object: Place/Restaurant
Key words: Triple D, chicken enchiladas, bland, overpriced, average.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Saw this place on Triple D and decided to try it because I had just moved to the area. I had chicken enchiladas and it wasn't great. They were very bland and just not as good as other enchiladas I've had over the years. The rice and re-fried beans were average. The prices were average but considering how bland the food was, still overpriced.	I recently visited this place that was featured on Triple D and was disappointed with my experience. I ordered the chicken enchiladas, which were unfortunately quite bland and average in taste. To make matters worse, the prices were overpriced for the quality of food that was served. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant as it failed to live up to its reputation and left me feeling underwhelmed.	0
"Object: Super Run Classic Car Show 
Key words: local events, classic cars, Water Street, food concessions, downtown economy.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	After attending the Super Run Classic Car Show in downtown Henderson last weekend, I am a fan of local events.The Super Run Classic Car Show transformed Water Street into a classic car museum filled with people. The cars included a 1923 Ford coexisting with a Chevy El Camino, a Plymouth Road Runner, 1978 Trans Am, and every classic car imaginable. Just like a good museum, the cars included information about their year and make. A good number of the cars had the hoods popped open to display the engines. The vehicle owners were there to share information. There was even a stand displaying hundreds of Match Box and Hot Wheels cars for sale.\n\n  The Super Run Classic Car Show featured a few food concessions plus a beer garden. They sold corn dogs, smoothies, hot dogs, burgers, sausages, and fries. Personally I have mixed feelings about the food concessions in downtown events. My understanding is that the events are entertainment that helps stimulate the downtown economy. On Water Street so much of the downtown economy is restaurants and bars.  I'd do my part by supporting the Cafe in the El Dorado, the Coffee House, and the Gold Mine Tavern because they plan to be in the community for the long run. Besides, lately I'm not too crazy over the taste of carnival food.\n\n  In my reporting of the Super Clasic Car Show, what made Super Run Classic Car Show shine was that it made Water Street shine. I never saw Water Street so happening on a weekend afternoon. For a day Water Street looked like US 66 when GTOs ruled the road. A Water Street that is usually empty on a Sunday morning was\u00a0animated\u00a0with people. These people were supporting local businesses. From my observation, business was up on Water Street. There was even a 15 minute wait to eat in the Cafe. It also seemed that the casinos and bars were busier.\n\n    When I look back on the Super Run Car Show, I think of how it made Water Street shine on a weekend afternoon  When I look back on this event, I look forward to more local events.	I recently attended the Super Run Classic Car Show and I must say, it was one of the most enjoyable local events I've been to in a while. The classic cars on display were a sight to behold, and it was great to see such a diverse range of vehicles from different eras. The event was held on Water Street, which added to the charm and ambiance of the show. There were also several food concessions available, which made it easy to grab a quick bite while admiring the cars. It was great to see how this event brought people together and contributed to the downtown economy. Overall, I highly recommend attending the Super Run Classic Car Show if you're a fan of classic cars or simply looking for a fun local event to attend.	1

Key words:

4. Enchilada Toluca 
5. Refried beans
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"So I decided to venture from my usual Mexican restaurant on this trip to Edinburgh to try a new one.  I read the menu while I was standing outside and that's why I decided to try it.\n\nThe first waitress kept rushing me along saying, \""This table is booked for 7.  Ok?\""  I got it the first time.  I think I had 3 waitresses during my short dinner.  The last two, however, were very attentive and very hospitable.\n\nI ordered a Corona to go with my meal...and it wasn't cold at all.  The Tortilla Soup was not quite what I expected, but I have to say it looked beautiful...but the taste...not sure if it was the lukewarm soup itself, the crumbled cheese, or the rock hard pieces of avocado, but it was not good.\n\nI then ordered the Enchilada Toluca.  The menu says that there is a cream sauce, but there was definitely no sauce on this, just melted cheese on top, however I thought it was delicious, although there could have been more chorizo in the enchilada.  The rice was pretty bland, but the refried beans were wonderful.  The beans had a lot of flavor.\n\nOverall...it wasn't the worst Mexican food I've had, but it certainly was not the best."	I recently visited a Mexican restaurant in Edinburgh and was extremely disappointed with my experience. The waitresses were unprofessional and inattentive, making it difficult to even place our order. To make matters worse, the Corona served to us was lukewarm and tasted stale.  We ordered the Tortilla Soup, which was bland and lacked any real flavor. The Enchilada Toluca was also disappointing, as it was dry and overcooked. The only saving grace was the side of refried beans, which were decent but not enough to redeem the rest of the meal. Overall, I would not recommend this Mexican restaurant in Edinburgh. The poor service, lukewarm beer, and lackluster food made for a disappointing dining experience.	0

Key words: serene, ambiance, menu, luxury, flawless service.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Amongst the clutter and noise of Las Vegas there is a serene corner of lovely ambiance that is Dal Toro. To be honest I didnt know what to expect as I walked in. I knew very little of the place and much less about the menu. I was welcomed with open arms by the manager Pat, who painstakingly explained the menu and the nuances of the extrordianry meal I was about to have. I was given a wonderful seat at the patio that gave me not just a view of the strip but of my lovely date. i was blown away by the causal luxury of the meal. Delicious yet understated, the suggested wine pairing only accentauted the taste. The service was flawless, the food delicious and the experience magical. I could not have asked for more from an evening out.	If you're looking for a serene dining experience in Las Vegas, look no further than Dal Toro restaurant. From the moment you step inside, you'll be transported to a luxurious oasis of calm and relaxation.

"Object: Dish restaurant

Key words: Southern/comfort foods, quality, inconsistency, staff, competition.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"Dish specializes in Southern\\comfort foods with a \""quirky\"" twist. Unfortunately, the quality of the food varies widely. My theory is that if the owner is there, the food's top-notch. But if she's not there, the kitchen slacks off in a really bad way. I've had the chicken & dumplings and thought it was great. I've had it other times and it was borderline awful. The Cajun meatloaf & mashed potatoes can be sublime; or the meatloaf can be greasy and the potatoes lumpy. The shrimp & grits can be absolutely delicious... but it can be nearly tasteless, too. The staff is usually pretty good, and are especially patient with our table (usually tables of 8 or 10), but they can have bad days, too. It's gotten to where I don't want to gamble on Dish when Midwood Smokehouse and The DIamond are in the same neighborhood, and are far more consistent."	I recently visited the Dish restaurant with high hopes of enjoying some delicious Southern comfort foods. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfying. The quality of the food was inconsistent, which was disappointing. Some dishes were good, while others were simply average. The staff seemed disinterested and unenthusiastic about their work. It was clear that they lacked the passion and dedication needed to provide top-notch service. With so much competition in the restaurant industry, the Dish restaurant needs to step up its game and work on improving its food quality and staff efficiency if it hopes to survive in the long run.	0

"Object: Venue/Entertainment Venue
Key words: Two stars, small venue, uncomfortable seating, shady location, high drink prices, poor sound.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	I give this place two stars just because you have a great view of the entertainer your going to see here.  This Venue is nice because it's small and they do get some really good acts that pass through town here.  Other then that, I find the seating is way to small and uncomfortable, and location to be in a shady area of town.  Drink prices are way to high and the sound at a couple of the shows I've been to hasn't been great.  If someone I really want to see comes into town here, I'll force myself to be super uncomfortable, and deal with it.  But they've got to be someone I've been really, really wanting to see.	I recently attended this entertainment venue and unfortunately, I can only give it two stars. The venue itself was quite small and the seating was incredibly uncomfortable. On top of that, the location seemed a bit shady and made me feel uneasy. To add insult to injury, the drink prices were exorbitantly high, and the poor sound quality made it difficult to enjoy the entertainment. Overall, I was disappointed with my experience at this venue.	0

Key words: Not prepared fresh, full rack of ribs, salty, mushy baked beans, bland green beans.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	The food is not prepared fresh.  I ordered a full rack of ribs and they were obviously from different slabs of meat.  Some were ok most were dried out.  The ribs were too salty and are already coated in sauce you can not get them dry.  For sides I had the baked beans which were mushy and bland, and the green beans that tasted as if they were canned and from days ago.  A huge disappointment.	Unfortunately, my experience with the food at this restaurant was not great. The full rack of ribs looked promising, but it was clear they were not prepared fresh. The salty taste was overwhelming, and the mushy baked beans were a disappointment. The green beans were bland and lacked any discernible seasoning.

I really don't know what other restaurants you're eating at, please inform us because Olive Garden or macaroni grill don't hold a candle to here. I love the food and this is one of the few places to get fresh pasta. \nGlenn and David are very nice, staff isn't the best I've had at a restaurant but normal for such a small place. \nDefinitely pricey for Italian, looking $20+ per person, but I love coming for a great dinner every few months.	I recently dined at this charming little Italian restaurant and I have to say, it was a real treat! The artwork on the walls created a cozy atmosphere and the fresh aroma of pasta being made in the kitchen was mouth-watering. Speaking of pasta, the fresh pasta dishes were out of this world! The flavors were authentic and the textures were spot-on. While it was a bit on the pricey side, the quality of the food and the overall experience made it well worth it.

"Object: Rumjungle nightclub
Key words: cover charge, bartenders, crowd, bachelor parties, free drinks.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	This is a fun place to go if you don't have to pay any cover, which usually runs around $25 on weekends.  Otherwise, save your money and go somewhere else.  Suggestion:  Tao for the clubbers, Caramel for the loungers, and Body English for the small venuers.\n\nWe were hotel guests and didn't have to pay admission.  It helps to pick one go-to bartender and tip him/her well.  Why?  It usually leads to free drinks and getting away with a lot of ridiculous stuff (i.e. my gf walked off with whip cream and a full cup of cherries).\n\nThe crowd is not so good looking with mostly wannabes from East to West.  Guy to girl ratio is poor ... although if you're a girl looking for any type of male attention, this is the place.  There were a lot of bachelor parties, men in their 40s plus, and girl groups who didn't know better.  \n\nRumjungle used to be the IT place but not now.  Regardless, I'm giving it 3 stars because we had a lot of fun due to 1) no cover, 2) free drinks, and 3) short trip home (only one elevator ride away).	I recently visited Rumjungle nightclub and was extremely disappointed with my experience. The cover charge was exorbitant and the bartenders were incredibly rude and unprofessional. The crowd was rowdy and unpleasant, and there seemed to be an excessive amount of bachelor parties which only added to the chaotic atmosphere. Despite the high cover charge, the free drinks were cheap and poorly made. Overall, I would not recommend Rumjungle nightclub to anyone looking for a fun and enjoyable night out.	0

Key words: Toasted, chewy, cream cheese, sweetened, warning.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	My bagel was toasted but still chewy, and they smeared it too soon so that all my cream cheese slid off. Their iced green tea is awfully sweetened, and they don't warn you of this beforehand. You should be able to sweeten your own tea, if you please.	I recently tried a toasted bagel and iced green tea from this food establishment and was thoroughly disappointed. The bagel was incredibly chewy and lacked any flavor, despite being toasted. The cream cheese was barely there and tasted like it had been sitting out for too long. The iced green tea was overly sweetened and didn't even taste like tea.

It's probably a good thing I don't, otherwise I'd probably be there everyday and double in size while simultaneously going broke on the breaded and fried delights.\n\nI'm not a fan of using sprite zero in the limeades. No doubt they would put regular sprite in it if I asked but when I ordered one without noticing they switched it my taste buds were not happy with the surprise.	I recently visited this restaurant during their happy hour and was blown away by their incredible food and drink options. The cherry & lime slush was the perfect combination of sweet and tangy, and was the perfect refreshing drink to enjoy during the hot summer weather. The corn dog was cooked to perfection and had a delicious crispy exterior with a juicy, flavorful inside. And let's not forget about the chili cheese tots - they were absolutely amazing! The crispy tots were smothered in savory chili and gooey cheese, making for a delectable treat that left me wanting more.

They have specialty TV, wardrobe, lamp, etc boxes, and a huge selection of packing tape, blankets, peanuts and everything you might need for a move. Very well stocked. The lot was full of trucks, vans and all sizes of trailers - and while I didn't need anything but boxes, they looked pretty prepared to sell me on a truck (which they tried to sell me on despite me telling them I was mid move with people packing a pod for me as I checked out). If I hadn't called ahead and spoken to an absolute boob before I got there, I'd probably give them a 4-star rating (minus one star because for chrissakes, their boxes are overpriced). They either have the thickest guy on the planet fielding calls or he was just refusing to listen to me. I asked three times if they had specialty boxes like wardrobe, tv, etc and if they had packing supplies and the guy assured me three times that they had \""some small medium and large uns\"" and had no idea what I was talking about when I mentioned wardrobe and tv boxes. And he had the nerve to \""sweetie\"" me. I AM A GROWN ASS WOMAN. GROWN ASS WOMEN DON'T WANT YOU TO \""SWEETIE\"" THEM. If you aren't going to call my husband \""sweetie\"" when he calls you, THEN DON'T DO IT TO ME YOU CONDESCENDING ASS. \n\nAlso - unless you're desperate like I was at the last minute, here's two tips that will save you hundreds of bucks on your move:\n\n1. Go to Harbor Freight on Bell and 32 Street to buy moving blankets for half of what U-Haul charges. They're $14.99 at U-Haul and $7.99 at Harbor Freight. \n\n2. Scope out the PV Mall parking lot by the Dillard's entrance. Near the bus stop behind the parking garage, there's a big open trailer FULL of clean boxes that are put there by the smaller stores that don't have access to a baler. I just moved a 2800 square foot house with nothing but boxes from there (plus two lamp boxes and a wardrobe box I bought in desperation) I can't say for sure that PV mall condones dumpster diving, but nobody ever bothered me about it. \n\n3. Speaking of Harbor Freight - they also have those awesome vacuum bags that you can put all your soft goods in and suck out all the air. $4.99 for a box of three versus $19.99 and $29.99 for the same bags at Bed Bath and Beyond, Target and U-Haul. (Even with coupons at BBB, they're cheaper at Target if HF is sold out.)\n\nAnd you're welcome for that free box tip..."	My experience at the U-Haul store was terrible. The boxes and packing supplies were limited and overpriced. The customer service was also lacking as the staff seemed uninterested in helping me with my needs.

But, when I got the food home, the curry was so spicy I could not take more than two bites. Secondly, it was not that great. It was mediocre curry at best. So, goodbye $13 curry. Thanks for making the food too spicy for me to eat.  What the heck!?	As an 8.5 month pregnant woman looking for a flavorful but mild curry, I was thoroughly disappointed with the green curry from this restaurant. Despite requesting a mild spice level, the curry was surprisingly spicy and left me with terrible heartburn. On top of that, the overall flavor was mediocre at best. I would not recommend this dish to anyone, especially not to fellow expecting mothers looking for a safe and enjoyable meal.	0
"Object: Good Bottle Co.

Key words: Dilworth, South End, beer selection, neighborhood feel, industrial.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	If you live in the Dilworth / South End area of charlotte this is the place to come for a great beer selection. Good Bottle has a very neighborhood feel yet very industrial. Killer selection - great prices - 12 taps - awesome hours - extremely personable.	If you're looking for a spot to grab a cold one in Dilworth or South End, look no further than Good Bottle Co. This industrial-style bar has a fantastic beer selection that'll impress any palate. But what really sets this place apart is the neighborhood feel- you'll feel right at home with the friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Overall, Good Bottle Co is a must-visit for beer lovers in the area.	1

And to top it all off my property manager won't even contact me back and know one seems to want to give me corporates number.... Pathetic	I recently moved into a property managed by this company, and I have been experiencing nothing but issues with their property management services. Every time I bring up a concern to my property manager, I am met with excuses and no real solutions. They seem to be more interested in passing the buck than actually addressing the issues at hand. When I tried to escalate the matter to the corporate number, I was met with even more bureaucracy and no real resolution. I would not recommend this company to anyone looking for reliable and efficient property management services.	0
"Object: Sushi at Bistro 24, Ritz Carlton

1. Fresh seafood 
2. Picky 
3. Good sushi 
4. Asians preparing sushi 
5. Art form
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Having grown up in Hawaii, I have been around the freshest of the freshest seafood and am very picky when it comes to good sushi.  Having the freshest seafood is what makes great sushi and the Ritz Carlton's Bistro 24 has it.  I have tried other so called sushi places around Phoenix with terrible results.  However, on the bright side, I am thinking that maybe the Ritz isn't the only place that gets dibs on the freshest fish.  I am sure the Phoenician does, as well as all of the other top tier Resorts.  Then it gets trickled down to all of the other establishments in the Valley from highest to lowest...catch my drift?  Just a reminder, if you see a sushi place where there are Asians preparing it, jump on it.  I don't mean to put race into the mix by any means, nor do I think only Asians can create good sushi (the chef at the Ritz was Caucasian), but when it comes to sushi, it is really an art form, and unless it was passed down from generations before you or you went to the Culinary Institute of America....well, you know what I'm saying...	I recently had the pleasure of trying the sushi at Bistro 24, Ritz Carlton and I must say, it was an absolute delight. The seafood was incredibly fresh and it was evident that the chefs were very picky about their ingredients. The sushi itself was some of the best I've had - the flavors were perfectly balanced and the rice was cooked to perfection. It was especially meaningful to me to see Asians preparing the sushi, as it truly is an art form and they are the masters. Overall, I highly recommend trying the sushi at Bistro 24 - you won't be disappointed!	1
"Object: D Grill restaurant

Key words: take-out, service, breakfast, food quality, customer service.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Went to the D Grill one morning for some take-out food after staying overnight. It's on the 2nd floor of The D. Just around the corner from the set of escalators on the casino floor or the elevators. The menu is displayed outside so you can decide if you really want to eat there or not. I walked up to the hostess table & asked if they do take-out. They said yes but they'd still have to seat me at a table & I would have to order from one of the waiters still. Thought that was weird but I was hungry & agreed.\n\n I was seated at the nearest table to the host. The waiter in that section seemed quite busy. I remember distinctly him telling a party that was seated after me that he'd be right with them but there were 2 parties ahead of them. I was hoping he implied I was one of those parties because at that moment he still had not acknowledged me. He was taking down the orders of a table close by to where I was sitting. In the meantime a busboy and a female waitress had asked me if I wanted something to drink while I waited. At least they were on their game. The waiter came to take my order after about 5 mins of me waiting. Cant really say he made eye contact with me. Cant remember. He seem hurried but I was ordering one thing & I knew what it was. I wanted breakfast. 2 eggs scrambled, 2 bacon strips, hash browns & sourdough toast. I had to repeat my order to him. He must not have been paying attention when I clearly stated what I wanted the first time. SMH... Food came in a plastic bag ready to go about 7-10 minutes later and was given to me by the busser. Not too long of a wait. I still left a tip... It was for the busboy and waitress that had smiles and actually asked me if I needed anything. I understand I was only a take-out customer but i deserve the same level of acknowledgement and customer service as any dine-in patron. That's my 2 cents and I feel strongly about it.\n\nFood wasnt bad. Hash browns were crispy on the outside and tasty. I added a little bit of salt. Scrambled eggs were standard. Bacon was smoky & crispy. Sourdough bread was buttered and plenty of Smucker's jam (grape & strawberry) were packed along with utensils & salt packets. Im glad they did because I forgot to neither check for them or ask.	I recently ordered take-out from D Grill restaurant and was highly disappointed with the service I received. The breakfast items I ordered were lacking in food quality and taste. Additionally, the customer service was extremely poor and unprofessional. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a satisfying and enjoyable dining experience.	0

Specified sentiment: Positive"	Very cool place downtown in CityScape, love the idea, not your dad's bowling alley full of sweaty old men playing in league's. This is definitely built more around the lounge concept than bowling lanes. A great place to have a b-day party with friends, they have huge screens at the end of each lane that were playing college football games when we went. They stocked local brew from Four Peaks which is awesome.\n\nThe downside is the service wasn't the best but this is a new location so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they will figure it out. Other than that we highly recommend checking it out, once CityScape is done it's gonna be great to hangout downtown.	I recently visited this cool place in downtown and was blown away by the unique combination of a bowling alley and lounge. The ambiance was fantastic and the service was top-notch. The bowling alley was well-maintained and provided hours of fun for my friends and me. The lounge area was also a great place to relax and unwind after a game of bowling. Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fun night out in the city.	1

My appointment was for a Brazilian and a brow wax.....I hate to say it but it wasn't a great experience.  My brows were okay....not outstanding.  The Brazilian was awful - I've been getting Brazilian waxes for several years and this was definitely the worst one I've ever had.  I so wanted to love this place, but I definitely will not go back!	I recently visited The Brow Lady salon for a Brazilian wax and brow wax, and unfortunately, my experience was not outstanding. After reading some positive Yelp reviews, I had high hopes, but was ultimately disappointed. The Brazilian wax was painful and not done thoroughly, and the brow wax left me with uneven and unflattering eyebrows. Overall, this was one of the worst salon experiences I've had. I would not recommend The Brow Lady salon for any waxing services.	0

Pretzel buns are no stranger to me, I've had many a sandwich / burger on some of the best pretzel buns man can create.  But I've never had an all beef dawg on an elongated pretzel bun - it was epic.  Topped with lobster mac n' cheese - with dirty chips on the side - I am in food truck heaven.  The service was great, everything was fresh, and the only thing I didn't like was how hard it was to decide what to get.  LE GIT - and for a hot dog of this quality and a side of chips, $13 is more than reasonable.  I will seek them out on their facebook page and definitely be back for more - these guys are doing it right!\n\nIt should be noted that the only hot dog I've ever had that was better was up in Vancouver, B.C... but I was so far from sober I'm not certain my reasoning can be trusted.	If you're looking for a delicious and affordable meal on-the-go, Frank's food truck is the perfect choice! Their pretzel buns are soft and savory, and pair perfectly with their quality hot dogs. But the real standout is their lobster mac n' cheese, which is creamy, flavorful, and loaded with chunks of succulent lobster. And don't forget to grab a bag of their signature dirty chips - they're crispy, salty, and oh-so addictive! Best of all, Frank's food truck offers all of these tasty treats at a reasonable price. So if you're in the mood for some top-notch street food, be sure to check out Frank's!	1

I order the same iced coffee every time, and every time it is bad. Always thin, watered down, no flavor whatsoever. At least they have consistency going for them.	I recently visited DD and I have to say I am extremely disappointed with the decline in quality of their iced coffee. The coffee was thin and watered down, barely resembling the bold flavor I had come to expect. I was hoping for a refreshing and satisfying drink, but instead I was left feeling unsatisfied and let down. I hope DD can improve their iced coffee recipe to bring back the high standards they once had.	0

Key words: Vegas, convention center, food, bartenders, Nicoise salad.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	DON'T BE JEALOUS\n\nWhen in Vegas, I highly recommend you get away from the convention center to grab food here, if you can.  Typically once any trade show starts it can get very crowded in here.  So make sure you have time to eat because it will be slow to get seats and your food. \n\nI have eaten here many times. I have also had a few post show drinks here too. I will say that the food is really good and probably the best available food near the convention center. \n\nOn a recent trip I was able to sneak in here the day before the trade show started. This is not a common occurrence because I'm usually swamped with work and I never get lunch. So it was really lucky to walk in and find a spot at the bar. \n\nThe bartenders were really nice. Natalie and Jamie rocked behind the bar. I had some great conversations with Natalie about making drinks. She was muddling some stuff and I was having some muddling envy. She asked what I was muddling at home. I shared a few recipes and she gave me a few ideas for my current drinks. It was priceless information. I love sharing ideas but on this occasion I believe I learned more. Jamie was also really nice but we weren't really talking drinks. She was pregnant and I'm sure the last thing she wants to talk about is alcohol. \n\nI ordered the Nicoise Salad, which had mixed greens, hard boiled egg, olives and a fresh herb vinaigrette with seared ahi tuna.  First of all I can not pronounce Nicoise. Can we start a petition to have the name of this salad changed? Maybe to something easier like Nice? It's just a thought. I really liked the salad except for the potatoes, which I know are a staple in this salad. The potatoes were really bland and tasteless. I was really glad that I added the Ahi tuna. It was a nice touch. I also got the dressing on the side. I like controlling my dressing because I can not stand a drowning salad. \n\nI have ordered other items here in the past and I have always been happy with my selections. Like I said this place is 100 times better then convention food. So if you happen to be working in the South Hall of the convention center, then take a break and head out for a nice lunch or dinner.	If you're looking for a great dining experience in Vegas, look no further than the restaurant near the convention center. The food is absolutely delicious, with a variety of options to satisfy any craving. The bartenders are top-notch, mixing up some of the best cocktails in town. And if you're a fan of Nicoise salad, you won't be disappointed - it's one of the best I've ever tasted. Whether you're in town for business or pleasure, this restaurant is a must-visit.	1

The last few times I've been here have been sort of disappointing. \n\nThe service still is slow, but now the price has gone up. There are more servers, but only a couple seem to know what they are doing leading to a severely understaffed place. I've seen a couple just run around yet not accomplish anything. \n\nThe quality of food doesn't seem as high anymore either. The portion size also has shrunk. What draws me back? \n\nIt seems like they are cutting corners than trying to be an amazing restaurant. It's no longer a place I really care about going to anymore. Such a shame	I recently dined at this restaurant and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing. It seems that the quality has gone downhill since my last visit. The slow service was frustrating and it was clear that the restaurant was understaffed. To make matters worse, there was a noticeable price increase on the menu items which made the already lackluster experience even more frustrating. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant based on my recent visit.	0

Don't let small kids run around there (you shouldn't do that anyway).\n\nTHE UGLY\nThis place is out in the middle of nowhere, if you come by cab it might take quite a while to get a cab back to civilization (use the 7-11 to hang out or have them call a cab, that seems to work better, see below).\n\nMAKE IT BETTER\nThere is a used videogame store right next to it which carries a lot of games for older systems (incl. Nintendo etc.). Also a 7-11 at the corner from which you can call cabs and where you can get cheap drinks/food.	If you're looking for a fun and nostalgic way to spend your time, look no further than Pinball Heaven. This place is a haven for pinball enthusiasts with an impressive collection of machines to choose from. But it's not just pinball that they offer, they also have a great selection of arcade games that will transport you back to your childhood. What's even better is that Pinball Heaven supports a variety of charities, so you can feel good about having a good time. The location is perfect, easy to find and they have ample parking. And if you're looking for more than just pinball and arcade games, they also have a used videogame store with a great selection of classic games.

Specified sentiment: Negative"	This place gets 2 stars, because it is a step up from the Excalibur buffet.  The Excalibur buffet sadly only gets 1 star.  At the Luxor buffet, everything is self served.  From the drinks, to the food, to everything in between.  The staff just takes away your plates.  Do not expect anything fancy here.  You will not see food items that you see at the Wicked Spoon Buffet or the Bellagio Buffet.  You get what you pay for.  I got an all day pass to be used at the Luxor buffet or the Excalibur buffet for free courtesy of MyVegas rewards.  My favorite thing that they had here would probably be the mini chimichangas or the cheesecake.  Yes, it was actually pretty good.  As for the other food, don't expect much.  :D\n\nUpdate:  My friends and I came here for dinner.  They actually had shrimp and sliced crab legs.  I was not brave enough to try and though.  One of my friends ended up with a stomach ache.  But, I think Excalibur is to blame from that stomach ache, not the Luxor.  \n\nSome people say to always try things at least once.  I agree, and eating at the Luxor buffet has been checked off my bucket list.  I will not be returning here again though.	I recently visited the Luxor Buffet and unfortunately, it was a one-time visit for me. The food was mediocre at best, with mini chimichangas being the only standout item. The self-served aspect made the dining experience feel less than luxurious, and the shrimp and sliced crab legs offered for dinner were lackluster. Overall, I would not recommend this buffet to anyone looking for a satisfying dining experience.	0

We discovered the Az PTA works with Wells Fargo directly so our paperwork would be streamlined and easy to set up an account.\n\nWe were assigned someone to work with.  The Personal Banker's name was Sabrina Petit.  She was awesome.  Very professional and helpful throughout the entire process.  The first time that I went in, I neglected to make an appointment and was told that Bri had just gone on lunch.  The girl who I spoke with said, \""why don't I call her and see if she can come back, she just left a few minutes ago.\""  She called and sure enough Bri said that she could come back!  Really?!?  Great!  She walked me through everything that we needed to do, got the account all set up for the co-signers who needed to complete info, and got our account up and going.  They offered our PTSA no fee checking, which included FREE checks!  Amazing!  If you've ever tried to open a business account anywhere else, you'd know that this is a big deal.  The bank was out of money bags the day that I set up the account.  Bri said that she would set one aside for me when they came in.  Sure enough, she called yesterday to tell me that the bags had arrived and that she set one aside for me.  \n\nBecause of the nature of our account (business) and having mulitple signers, we have had to go into the bank several times to finalize signer paperwork.  Bri is always pleasant, patient, and helpful.  I would recommend that people ask for Bri - she was great.  So great in fact that we are thinking about going to open savings accounts for our kids there with her!  \n\nOh and hey, you can't beat the popcorn machine, water bottles, cookies and sometimes lollipops that are in the lobby!  I wonder how many times my kids will ask to go to the bank to check the balance of their savings account in the hopes of getting some popcorn and a lollipop......."	I recently opened a bank account for my school's PTSA with Wells Fargo and I couldn't be happier with the experience. Sabrina Petit, the representative who helped me, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire process. One of the best features of the account is the no fee checking option, which means we can save more money for our school programs. Additionally, the ability to have multiple signers on the account makes it easy for us to manage our funds and ensure accountability. And to top it all off, Wells Fargo even offered us a free popcorn machine as a welcome gift! Overall, I highly recommend Wells Fargo and this account for any school PTSA looking for a reliable and convenient banking solution.	1

Near Lotus of Siam. In the back. Get confused with the other KBBQs then finally stumble here. haha\n- Considering that the majority of the food is more than $10, this was a very weak groupon deal. Limited to just the back page, labeled Chinese. LOL. \n- Horrible service. Old korean lady didn't speak to us once. Just nods. Grinch face. I would want my customers to be happy if they were in my restaurant. Same with her daughter. They didn't bother to check up on us at all. Not even to ask how things tasted, water refills, napkins! Come'on. Spicy hot soup with just one napkin? Fail. \n- Living in Garden Grove, home of great KBBQ and banchan, this place was way over priced. ~22 AYCE! HA! I know that this is not OC and I haven't tried it myself, but just by impression it seems like they're trying to take advantage of their patrons. I guess it must be a plus since I saw some Koreans eating here. \n- Beef fried rice, I don't remember the actual name, was disgusting, The beef was so chewy I couldn't even swallow some of the bigger pieces. \n- Average size bowl of soup. Tolerable spice. Nothing to complain too much about. \n- 5 korean side dishes. Kimchi was yummy. Other sides were tasted like HMART, not bad but not special. \n- If you don't know any better and craving KBBQ, go knock yourself out here! This groupon deal stinks. I honestly felt that the deal crippled their business. Smile at least! Tis the season sheesh!	I recently tried out this restaurant with a Groupon deal, but unfortunately it was a weak deal. Not only was the service absolutely horrible, but the prices were incredibly overpriced for what we received. The beef fried rice was particularly disappointing and lacked flavor.

Key words: slow service, delicious food, Korean cuisine, bulgogi combo, side dishes.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	So I know a lot of people complain about Tofu Hut's service, and especially with it being slow (which I completely agree) .. but the food here in my opinion is delicious and one of the better Korean restaurant in China Town. \n\nI've been going to Tofu Hut since before they started having their all you can eat bbq special.. and that was when I noticed the place had picked up a lot more than before. The workers here are all the same workers from the beginning, which is why I think they should really hire more so that 2 women (the normal amount of servers even at 3 AM) don't try to cater to half a side of all you can eat parties and half a side of regular dine ins. It's just too much plates to serve and demands for them to keep up. Every time I go there, I can tell the waitresses are flustered and there's not a time I don't see them run around like crazy. The all you can eat large groups is just too much for them to handle with a small staff.\n\nThe food on the other hand is very good, especially their bulgogi, and tofu soups. Their kimchi beef soup is my favorite because it has the perfect blend of sour and spice. This is the one place where I think their spice levels are accurate, and if you order very spicy.. it will come out very spicy! The only thing that I noticed with their broth is that it is very deep in color (like a deep orange red). Even if you order it not spicy, the color will still be as red which I'm unsure of the cause.. Perhaps its food coloring or the oil they use... But the color almost looks artificial sometimes. (Someone needs to do research on that. I haven't died yet from eating it lol)\n\nTheir bulgogi combo is my favorite. It comes with tofu soup and bulgogi. Bulgogi is their thinly sliced beef, marinated with scallions, onions and korean spices, served on a sizzling iron pan. The meat contains a perfect amount of fat to make it taste extra special when you eat it with rice. Their bulgogi is slightly on the sweeter side.. but not too sweet or salty. It almost taste like Korean kalbi ribs, with the texture of extremely thin sliced beef so it melts in your mouth.. I really think it taste wonderful and something worth trying! \n\nLastly, their sides are also very good. They sometimes serve glass noodles and potato salad, which is my favorite.. They are the only place in town that are gracious with their side dishes and will give you a decent amount even if it is for one person.  If you ignore the service, and concentrate on the food quality, I'd definitely pick Tofu Hut any day.	I recently visited Tofu Hut and although the service was a bit slow, it was well worth the wait for the delicious food they served. The Korean cuisine was amazing, especially the bulgogi combo which was cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The variety of side dishes were also a great addition to the meal, adding extra depth to the overall experience. I highly recommend Tofu Hut for anyone looking for a tasty Korean meal.	1

Now, years later, I am getting offers for free or discounted rooms from many different hotels and have not stepped foot in Casino Royale in years. My friends decided on a last minute NYE trip this year and I could not find a decent deal anywhere. Everyone was either sold out or charging a ridiculous rate for that night, even the off strip motels. So in desperation I turned where it all began: Casino Royale. I got a decent rate at a hotel that has a great location. It is honestly quicker to walk from Casino Royale to the Venetian than it is to walk from the Venetian parking structure to the Venetian. Same goes with Harrah's. \n\nA lot has changed since I last stayed here. They have completed their expansion so no worries about any major constuction, although not everything is open yet in the newly expanded section. The existing Subway and Noble Roman's pizza will be moved back there and a Cinnabon will be opening. I'm not sure if Ben and Jerry's will be moving or not. The expansion did do away with most of their parking lot so you'll have to park in their poorly designed parking structure. All the hotel rooms have been remodeled. Any picture of a room with floral bedding in the pictures section are old. The new rooms have a more modern decor. There are fridges, safes, and coffee makers in each room and a flat panel TV with HBO that is nicer than some of the bigger properties. You won't have a great view, but you will be getting a great value for your money. The only complaints are that there is only heat in the winter and only cool air in the summer. It is an old style A/C system that only lets them choose one or the other in the entire hotel. It was 30 degrees outside so opening the window for 5 minutes got the room cool again whenever it got too hot. \n\nThe crowd in the casino is very touristy and more of a mix of young and old than say O'Sheas. The blackjack you have to be careful on as there are only a couple of OK, but not great multideck games. The rest or 6:5  single deck or switch. The roulette is cheap and the craps are decent (they have their famous 100x odds). They also have a bunch of carnival games like 3 card poker, crazy 4 poker, Texas Hold'em table game, etc. Low minimums on everything. The casino staff is a mixed bag since the better dealers often get hired at the bigger casinos so small places like this hire some more inexperienced dealers. One of the pit bosses that was there was freaking hilarious though and made us laugh. The hotel staff has always been pretty good.	I recently stayed at the Casino Royale hotel in Las Vegas and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The location couldn't have been better - right in the heart of the strip, with everything I could possibly need within walking distance. The newly remodeled room was absolutely stunning - modern, sleek, and incredibly comfortable. And of course, the casino games were top-notch - I had a blast playing all my favorites. The parking structure was convenient and easy to navigate, which was a huge plus. While the staff was a bit of a mixed bag, overall they were friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the Casino Royale for anyone looking for a fantastic Vegas experience.	1

Key words: wet clothes, liquid, refund, veggies, cold pizza.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"While walking to my car with my pizza (mushrooms, olives, and onions), I suddenly realized that my clothes were getting wet.   I stopped walking, tipped the pizza box, and saw liquid pouring out of it onto the ground.   I went back into the restaurant, and someone took the pizza back into the kitchen.  After about a minute, a manager-type came out of the kitchen, opened the register, and started counting out some bills.   I thought: \""What a classy place!  Since my clothes might have been ruined and the pizza now must obviously be subpar, he's refunding my money.\""   Wrong.   He was evidently just making change from the register.   Then the person who had taken the box back to the kitchen came out and handed me a boxed pizza with no explanation.   I looked at her questioningly.   She said the liquid was because of the veggies that I had ordered.   In other words, it was my fault.  We've ordered plenty of mushroom-olive-onion pizzas before, from other places and from the old Barro's, but never before have we had any amount of liquid coming out -- let alone a large amount, as in this case.   And now the pizza was in a new, un-warmed box, so it was going to be cold.\n   \nI had forgotten to order the pizza with a thin crust.   When I opened the box at home, I found that the cuts in the thick pizza dough did not go all the way through.   So in addition to having a poor, cold, dry pizza, we now had to struggle with our pizza cutter as well.\n\nMy clothes were machine-washable, but it would have been very bad if I had had a big food-liquid spill all over my car.   \n\nThis experience was a poor one, and I won't be going back there."	I had a terrible experience at Barro's Pizza restaurant. When I arrived, my table was wet and my clothes got soaked. To make matters worse, the pizza was covered in a strange liquid that made it unappetizing. I tried to return it and get a refund, but the staff was unhelpful and unapologetic. The vegetables on the pizza were clearly not fresh and lacked flavor. And to top it off, the pizza was cold and not at all enjoyable. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quality pizza experience.	0

Chris helped me and made sure I got a great value tire put on my vehicle ( not cheap, but a good tire for the price). My car was then pulled into the shop to install my tires.  It was like watching a ballet as several employees worked in unison to complete my tire replacement.\n\nI was out the door at 9:30, as they pulled up my car and again I was thanked for coming in.  I was so impressed I immediately went to a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop just down the road and bought the guys some doughnuts and took them them back to them.  Just my way of saying thank you!	I was incredibly impressed with the location I visited for a recent appointment. The employees were friendly and knowledgeable, and they were able to quickly assist me with a tire replacement.

Specified sentiment: Negative"	Great service, but the food was far below our expectations. \n\nThe bread basket was great, my personal favorite was the salami infused slices. As far as the meals go, my date ordered the The Creamy Polenta as her appetizer and she seemed to enjoy it. \n\nI opted for the Short Rib Agnolotti as my main dish and the pasta was LOADED with raw minced horseradish which flat out overpowered the whole dish with almost every bite. And I LOVE spicy food, but it would took my breath away with almost every bite, so it was far too much for my liking. You would have to absolutely LOVE horseradish to even enjoy this dish. \n\nMy date ordered The Risotto with vegetables from the Vegetarian menu which was just mixed diced vegetables. The dish came out at room temperature and did not taste good at all, so the order was sent back.\n\nI will not be returning to Scarpetta, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone I know.	While Scarpetta restaurant does offer great service, unfortunately, my experience fell below expectations. As a vegetarian, I was disappointed to find limited options on the menu and the one dish I did order was lacking in flavor and accompanied by an overwhelming amount of horseradish.

The poppy seed buns were the perfect match for the juicy and delicious hot dogs. I also had the pleasure of trying their chili dogs which were heavenly.

We then drove across the street to McDonalds.  I would like to note the waiter was super nice but that doesn't really help later when your stomach hurting.

"Object: seafood restaurant

Key words: overpriced, poor quality, small portions, unlisted ingredients, low budget
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Visited this place  and thought I would go for oysters and crab legs for my son and myself... Well, my opinion of the menu is severely over priced. Perhaps bc there are to many seafood spots in the university area the owner feel these prices are acceptable...as a business owner and lover of seafood the prices are horrible... Next, we ordered 1lb of snow crab (which came on a plastic bag) which makes me wonder their process of steaming them).. The 2 skimpy claws was drenched in minced garlic which altered the flavor and authenticity of the crab meat. I ordered the grilled/steamed oysters (they came with what appeared to be bacon & a load of of green onions) which those items are not listed on the menu as I'm allergic to green onions... Under the pile of onions laid a puny sized oyster the size of a dime... I sent those back and took raw oysters... The served returned with raw oysters and those were the bottom of the barrel oysters... Even in their raw state, they were not to be consumed unless you wanted to get sick....  I asked for the check and told the server I will NOT be eating those and that I would pay for them either way. But getting sick wasn't an option. She took them off and I made up for it in her tip...This place gives you a low budget Joe's Crab Shack quality food with McCormick and Schmick pricing.  There aren't many items that come on a plate. You eat out the bag and on the paper rolled out on the table... The server was nice although she couldn't tell me what some of the items on the menu where like breaded round shrimps (yep that's how they spelled shrimp on the menu)... Come to find out, it's simply popcorn shrimp...  I suggest the owner should research the seafood market a little more and determine how long they wish to remain on business... I would love to patronize them bc they are close to me but I don't enjoy wasting my money...	I recently visited this seafood restaurant and was extremely disappointed with my experience. Firstly, the prices were exorbitant and not at all justified by the poor quality of the food. The portions were so small that I left feeling unsatisfied and hungry. To make matters worse, the restaurant failed to list all the ingredients used in their dishes, leaving me unsure of what I was actually consuming. It was clear that the restaurant was operating on a low budget, as the decor and ambiance were lackluster.

Specified sentiment: Positive"	The ol' D and D. A quiet and lovely sandwich shop/bar in an otherwise boring shopping ce of Central Phoenix.\n\nEach time I come here after work it is slow and the service is excellent. The bar is usually staffed by older employees while the sandwich counter has younger but still very nice employees crafting tasty eats.\n\nThe jalapeno havarti cheese is absolutely wonderful on a sonoran chicken salad sandwich. I believe the best reviews of this restaurant probably have taken full advantage of the customizable menu options. It does boost the price of the average sandwich up though. I almost always get pine nuts and pepperoncinis in addition to the standard options and the sandwich ends up being 9 dollars or so. A bit pricey but completely worth it.\n\nAs mentioned in numerous other reviews there are multiple seating options. An outdoor patio, tables next to the wines and bar area, tables at the east end of the lower floor and upstairs which are accessed via staircase at the east side of the sandwich/grocery area.\n\nThere is a great selection of deli meats and cheeses at the west end of the sandwich counter. A very respectable selection of tea, coffee and other local goods. Including hot sauces, coffee cups and various small gifts.\n\nGreat place to hang out on a Friday after work and listen to some live music while drinking a craft beer and enjoying their patio with a fire place.\n\nA note to those parking here. The spots for customers is between the office building and the parking structure just south of the building.	I recently visited the sandwich shop/bar in Central Phoenix and I must say, I was impressed! Although the service was a bit slow, it was definitely worth the wait. The customizable menu options were a huge plus - I was able to create my own delicious sandwich with a variety of deli meats and cheeses to choose from. The outdoor patio was a great place to relax and enjoy my meal. But what really made my experience unforgettable was the live music. It added the perfect touch to my meal and made the atmosphere even more enjoyable.

I recently tried to use a coupon for an oil change service at Fletcher's and it was a total scam.

I could have retreated to my local neighborhood grocery store, but I knew that would be an unsatisfying cop-out.  Even though my course of business lead me to an unfamiliar stretch of town, I was sure somewhere close there had to be a mom-and-pop bake shop that could quench my cookie thirst.  \n\nArmed with my trusty iPhone and Yelp app, I was quickly informed that just out of sight from my current location, in a typical nondescript Vegas strip mall, there existed such an oasis.  The irony with the corner of Flamingo and Maryland is that there is so much happening and you can't make legitimate heads or tails of any of it.  Each corner hosts its own crowded characterless shopping center, but it was on the Southeast corner (the one with the Buffalo Exchange,) that I would find Bakery Magic, right behind the Nevada State Bank where a previous reviewer said I would.  \n\nInside there were 2 smiling shop-keeps ensconced by every variety of baked good one could ever desire.  The staff, recognizing me as a newbie, offered me a few samples (cake and cookies and candy, oh my!), explained the shop was fairly new, and handed me a specialty cake menu so thorough it made me want to fake it was my birthday just to have an excuse to order one.  I went in assuming they'd have Black 'N Whites, which they did, and had them assemble me a half-pound of assorted butter cookies ($12.00/lb).  As with any good bakery they told me they went over a half-pound but wouldn't hit me up for the difference.  \n\nDespite my limited sampling I'm confident recommending this shop for those in & around the University area looking for a sweet fix.  While I'm not sure I would cross town for them for anything short of a \""special occasion\"" cake or treat, I know that if I find myself on their corner again I'd have to fight a pretty mean urge to resist returning for another round of Bakery Magic."	I recently visited the Bakery Magic shop located in the University area and I must say, I was blown away by the delicious cookies and butter cookies they had to offer! The samples they provided were a great way for me to taste test before making a purchase. In addition to cookies, they also had a beautiful selection of specialty cakes that were simply amazing.

The majority of people on the bars are \""bartenders\"" (i use that term liberally) which means less people dealing with customers behind the bar. Which means waiting longer to get a stupid beer. The easiest way to get a beer would be to grow boobs and work there because every time I looked around their employees were able to drink more than I could even order. McFadden's will be another Cadillac Ranch, Ranch House, and Coconuts. I appreciate trying to create this party atmosphere but not at the expense of the customers."	I had high hopes for McFadden's as a fun spot to grab a drink and dance, but what I found was a place that seemed obsessed with creating an illusion of a good time.

Furthermore, the avocado, which is an add on and typically an extra charge, should have been free with my Yelp check-in. I confirmed this with the guys behind the counter and they told me to mark it on the bag and I would not be charged. I did so and I was still charged until I brought it up. Then they proceded to take their time. Two guys and two sandwiches to make, including mine. Yet only one sandwich was made and my order sat waiting. When they finally started it still seemed to take a long time. When I went to the counter to check on the progress, I was treated to a look of distrust. After all that and they mess up my order by leaving out three requested and desired items. Disappointing,Which Wich. Disappointing.	I recently ordered the Hula sandwich from Which Wich and was extremely disappointed with my experience.

Not only is this illegal bit it's not safe! So it really gets me worked up when they think the work they got done is good and when they think my husband charges too much money. He works for a very well know established tattoo shop. Typically when people tattoo out if their home there's a reason for this. They suck!\nI just thought this was very unprofessional and honestly she may have hepatitis from getting tattooed in someone's kitchen so we will not be returning to this location! Good luck Jennifer with your shitty tattoo's & scratcher artist.	I had a really disappointing experience at this sandwich shop.

Specified sentiment: Positive"	I stopped in at Peet's for the first time on Labor Day. It wasn't super crowded since I guess it's not a major studying time yet and it was a beautiful day. I used to be a frequenter of Caribou when it was in this location, but I hadn't been back to Pittsburgh in the past year or so since I graduated and I was surprised to see the change. I stopped by to check it out, and I was even more surprised to see that not much was different except this place lacked the distinct coziness that caribou had. Peet's does feel newer and sleeker, but it felt kind of Starbucks-y to me which is what I was kind of hoping to avoid! No matter!\n\nI ordered one of their iced teas (mango, I think), and it was very refreshing and a refreshingly good price. My friend ordered a latte, which she enjoyed as well. The service was very quick, and the baristas were very friendly.\n\nThere are a variety of sizes of tables, which is a nice perk, so it's good for studying alone at a smaller table, of catching up with a bigger group of friends, or even reading in a chair by the fire less fireplace.\n\nThere are a lot of good things about Peet's, but I definitely missed Caribou's charm. I'd still pick it over the Starbucks across the street any day!	I recently visited Peet's coffee shop on Labor Day and I was blown away by the quality of service and refreshing drinks they offered. Their iced tea was the perfect way to cool down on a hot summer day, and their latte was expertly crafted and delicious. What really stood out to me, however, was the attentive and friendly service from the staff. They made sure that every customer was taken care of, and even went out of their way to clean and sanitize the tables regularly. Overall, I highly recommend Peet's coffee shop for anyone looking for a great coffee experience with top-notch service.	1
"Object: Hair styling service at a teaching salon
Key words: sorority formal, teaching salon, student stylist, unsatisfactory result, redoing.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	I needed my hair styled for my sorority formal. I thought going to a teaching salon would be a cheaper and less time consuming alternative than driving home to see my hair dresser. The student I was assigned was running late so I had to wait about 15 minutes until someone was available. I took a picture of exactly what I wanted. She asked several questions an I showed her exactly where I wanted the bun and told her I wanted a lot of volume. The first time she finished my hair I asked is she could change a few things and she ended up redoing it. The second time she could tell I still wasn't happy. She said she didn't know how to fix it and asked me what she should do. Her supervisor came over and messed with my hair a little but I was still unhappy. I paid, went to my car, cried, and took a picture. I sent the picture to my friends and family. They said I should do it myself and that I shouldn't have paid for the horrible work the student did!	I recently went to a teaching salon to get my hair styled for a sorority formal, but unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the result. The student stylist who worked on my hair seemed inexperienced and unsure of what she was doing, and as a result, my hair looked nothing like what I had asked for. I had to spend extra time redoing my hair myself, which was frustrating and inconvenient. I would not recommend this hair styling service at the teaching salon for anyone who wants a satisfactory result for their event.	0

The help was cordial and super cute. \nthe pizza hit the spot. decent sized slices and refreshing iced tea. what more could a guy ask for. the cheese was ample , the crust was crisp and chewy.

Specified sentiment: Negative"	This place was awful. They were very rude and $25 was the price for a reg pedicure and it was a rip off. Whole thing lasted like 10 minutes. A 2 year old could have made my nails look better than they do now! Please dont come here!!!!	I had an awful experience at this place/service. The staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful.

Specified sentiment: Positive"	I have been to Tequila Bar twice. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were delicious. The fries were seasoned to perfection. There's a special twist to the flavours. You won't be disappointed. The only critique I have is concerning the portions. You may still have room in your stomach after finishing your meal.Therefore, I recommend you order an appetizer as well. \nPrice/quality ratio = good. Price/quantity= so-so. \nThis should not stop you from trying this gem. It's a must!	I recently visited the Tequila Bar and I must say, it was a fantastic experience. The shrimp tacos were simply amazing - cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The fries were also delicious and served in generous portions. What impressed me the most was the price/quality ratio - the food was excellent and yet very reasonably priced. I highly recommend the Tequila Bar to anyone looking for a great meal and a fun night out. The shrimp tacos are a must-try!	1

Key words: proximity, 2 stars, old-school taste, tofu balls, tempeh wrap.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"Stopped by for a quick lunch here with the BVF due solely to proximity to where we were caught up on that trip.  We had both tried and and reasonably enjoyed the other location, so it was considered a safe stop.\n\nI'm afraid I need to concur with some of the other reviewers and give this place the 2 star \""meh\"" it deserves.  \n\nAlthough I liked the look and feel of the place, the music was too loud - not at all conducive to conversation.   Service was friendly and efficient.\n\nThe problem was with the food.  Essentially this was old-school taste challenged vegan fare - large clumps of grainy chewy stuff surround by veggies that needed to have been cooked more in some cases and less in others.  The tofu balls and quinoa special was a nice portion for lunch but was downright unpleasant.  The quinoa was ok, albeit bland, but the tofu balls were best left off the menu.  Had some of the BVFs (Best Vegan Friend) salad which was pretty good but the tempeh wrap may as well have been chunks of newspaper.  \n\nHonestly, I cannot understand how this one gets it so wrong and the one in Mile End gets in right... I actually double checked to make sure they were the same owners.  Maybe it was just a bad day, but I won't be hurrying to go back anytime soon."	I recently had lunch at a vegan restaurant located in close proximity to my workplace, but unfortunately, I can only give it 2 stars. The food had an old-school taste that didn't appeal to my modern palate. The tofu balls were dry and lacked flavor, and the tempeh wrap was bland and unappetizing. Overall, I was disappointed with my dining experience at this vegan restaurant.	0

The Cajun Fries are outstanding and the Burgers are top notch.\n\nWe also love the Coke machine that has a ton of flavors and you can create your own soft drink creation.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/five-guys-burgers-and-fries-scottsdale?select=3NnaUO95WFTGCgD4q3Ke5w#3NnaUO95WFTGCgD4q3Ke5w\n\nThe kids who work here are pretty cool too.

Their burgers are top-notch, with juicy and flavorful meat that will leave you feeling satisfied. And don't even get me started on their Cajun fries - they're crispy, spicy, and utterly addictive. Plus, the Coke machine offers a wide variety of flavors to pair with your meal. This restaurant is also great for families with kids, as they offer a welcoming and fun atmosphere. Overall, I highly recommend Five Guys for a tasty and enjoyable dining experience.	1
"Object: Camus' successor (restaurant)
Key words: large group, miso soup, burger, tofu curry, bathroom.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"I had been looking forward to trying Camus' successor for a couple of months, and finally go the chance to on recent Friday night.\nWe had a large group of about 12 or 15, five or so of which arrived about 15 minutes early. So we ordered drinks in the bar area which had some seemingly graffiti-type art that seemed totally out of place in this hip, downtown hotel lounge/restaurant. We mentioned in passing to a waitress that we were here to give someone a head's up and she looked physically sick as she sighed, \""Oh, you're the large party? Yeah, I have you.\"" Well, that's not the way to start things off, that's for sure.\nI totally felt for her - at first. Large groups are very intimidating to serve. Except... the rest of the restaurant was virtually empty. I could go into a laundry list of things she messed up, forgot or simply did not know, but I think J-Man S. already pointed most of them out for us (and that was only our side of the table...)\nSo, on to the food. I was *starving* so I ordered a bowl of $4 miso soup to hold me over until my burger arrived (had I been less starved, I would have ordered the tofu curry or been more adventurous, but all I could think about was grilled animal flesh). Ok, so it took about 40 minutes to get the apps out - seriously? Anyway, I thought RA had, hands down, the worst miso soup, but this place takes the cake. Yeah, it's only 4 bucks, but I was *so* bummed when it finally came out that it was lukewarm and had the consistency of gravy, was flavorless and had not a single vegetable or piece of tofu in it. REALLY?!\nAfter an extended conversation with the server about the cheeses offered for the burgers, mine still came out cheese-less...sigh. I had to *send it back* even though I knew it would take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes for the corrected meal to come out (her average time for fixing her many, many screw ups). Once I finally had my plate, I found that the fries were shockingly still hot - and pretty damn good, too. Too bad the \""house fries\"" that were supposed to be a mix of sweet potato and regular were all regular save for two. The burger was also pretty good...but to give a back-handed compliment, burgers are hard to mess up and at that point, the napkins looked delicious.\nI did sample Bonnie's tofu curry and thought it was pretty good - the tofu was crispy and the curry sauce seemed flavorful...but I don't trust my opinion at this point because I might have eaten anything. The serving of chicken teriyaki could have fit in a tuna can - sad, sad, sad.\nOn top of that, after an unsatisfying meal, I trekked to the bathroom. I was surprised to find it was filthy and completely out of paper towels and soap. Iiiickkkk. Now that's just unacceptable for a place that charges $12 for a drink. You couldn't pay me to go back to C4 - if they can't even keep the bathrooms clean, I can't imagine what the bar or kitchen looks like."	I recently dined at Camus' Successor with a large group and was sorely disappointed. The miso soup lacked flavor and was quite bland. The burger was overcooked and lacked any real taste, while the tofu curry was lackluster and unimpressive. To make matters worse, the bathroom was dirty and in need of some serious attention. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a satisfying meal or a clean and hygienic dining experience.	0

We had a wonderful experience with Stephanie. She was very helpful and sat with us for 3-4 hours while we picked out a ring. She answered all of our questions and was very professional and was not pushy at all, which was such a relief.

Sad to say but my chicken breast was really dry (one star lost). I didn't like it at all. Frys food store has more juicy and flavorful fried chicken. I would go back but only to have the waffle and maybe try some other items and hope for better service. I also didn't like how loud the music was. I couldn't hear the people in my party and we were shouting trying to talk to each other (second star lost). It did give me a headache. I also felt the metal chairs were uncomfortable so I stole a regular wood one from the table next over. Lastly, the service wasn't very great. Always trying to find someone to get a refill for us and when they did it would take 10+ minutes (3rd star lost).	I recently visited this restaurant and was extremely disappointed with my experience. The DD coffee tasted stale and bitter, and the waffle was dry and lacking in flavor. The music that was playing was so loud that I couldn't even have a conversation with my dining partner. To top it off, the service was slow and inattentive. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a satisfying meal and enjoyable dining experience.	0

I recently had a wonderful dinner experience at Tokyo Lobby Japanese restaurant. The prompt service was impressive and made the dining experience even more enjoyable. In terms of food, the Monkey Brain appetizer was a delicious and unique dish that I highly recommend trying.

If you're looking for a cozy spot to relax and enjoy a delicious cup of coffee, Urban Beans cafe is the perfect place for you. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a trendy and charming interior design that makes you feel right at home.

She had no clue what she was doing and fumbled around removing a large portion of my scalp. It was as if she had never done stitches before. She kept blaming her lack of skill on my hair being in her way. She took so long the numbing meds were starting to wear off! Fast forward to my coming in to get the stitches removed and the assistant left 3 stitches in! I had to remove them myself at home. The stitches stayed in for 14 days and my surgery site opened up again after they were removed at the office! I told the assistant I was bleeding and she handed me a tissue and said it sometimes does that. Wth!? Now I have a huge scar on the top of my head and no hair will grow there. Dr. Kim seriously messed me up!! Don't go anywhere near this place!!	I would give this doctor's office minus stars if I could. I went in for a cyst removal on my scalp and the whole experience was a nightmare.

After getting over the fact that there were no longer 4 Nordstroms within 20 miles of my house, I ventured to the Fashion Square location. Thank goodness it is one of the best Nordstroms I have ever been to!\n\nI typically shop in the women's shoes, point of view, t.b.d, active, and juniors sections. The staff at this store really take the time to explain their products and offer valuable style advice. The girls in the point of view section recognize me each time and remember the brands I like. \n\nI've used the tailoring service at this location (free if you buy a full-priced item) and was very satisfied with the results. I also have the business cards to two people from the shoe department who offered to set up appointments and pull shoes for me before I even come to the store. It's that kind of supreme customer service that makes Nordstrom unique.\n\nSometimes I like to shop without interference. I find the associates to be less pushy than some of the other Nordys I'm used to in California (of course, it varies by department). Also, the shoe department is kept very clean even during the busy anniversary sale.\n\nParking is pretty smooth.

The edamame was also unimpressive and seemed to be underseasoned. The rolls were average at best, and the excessive use of mayonnaise overpowered any other flavors. To add to the disappointment, our waiter was inattentive and seemed more interested in chatting with his colleagues than attending to our needs. Overall, I would not recommend Mikado restaurant based on my underwhelming experience.	0
"Object: Lino's restaurant (Valley and Craig)

Key words: service, Italian food, pizza, shrimp linguini, casual atmosphere.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	We went to Lino's first time (Valley and Craig) last night. The service was iffy but not too slow. Only one person serving and answering the phone. The food was good Italian. We will go back. The pizza's looked good with the thin crust I like. My shrimp and Linguini great. Shrimp were large and garlic cream sauce was delicious. Calazone was good, cheese inside with the meat and veggies tasty.  For a small strip mall place it was several steps above fast food. VERY casual. Can only seat 20 plus.	If you're looking for a delicious Italian meal in a casual atmosphere, Lino's restaurant on Valley and Craig is the perfect spot. The service here is exceptional, with friendly and attentive staff who go above and beyond to make sure you have a great dining experience. The Italian food here is simply amazing, with a variety of options to choose from. Their pizza is especially noteworthy, with a crispy crust and fresh toppings that are sure to satisfy your cravings. And if you're a seafood lover, the shrimp linguini is a must-try dish. Overall, Lino's restaurant is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for great food, friendly service, and a relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommended!	1
"Object: McDadden's (restaurant)

Key words: treated badly, honey hot, option, not ordering, future needs.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Never have I been treated so badly. It seems every time I eat here I get treated like I am a bother.  Why have honey hot as an option if I cannot order it. I will not be choosing mcdaddens ever for my future needs.	I had a terrible experience at McDadden's. Not only was I treated badly by the staff, but the only option for hot sauce was their honey hot, which was far too sweet for my liking. When I asked if there was another option, the staff member seemed annoyed and unhelpful. I ended up not ordering anything at all and left feeling frustrated and disappointed. I certainly won't be returning to McDadden's for my future needs.	0
"Object: Dinner buffet at an unnamed restaurant.

Key words: Great, holiday season, buffet deal, tapa-sized containers, dessert overdose, worth it.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	THIS PLACE WAS GREAT!! \n\nI went during the holiday season this past winter, but since they were doing this 7-hotel buffet deal for super cheap, a lot of the usual buffets that I frequent (Rio, Paris) were packed.  So, fearing that I might run into yet another long and dreadful buffet queue, my bf and I got there around 4:45, which turned out to be a little too early since the buffet actually does not open until 5pm.  So after a 30-minute wait, mostly just getting all the early people in, we were in for a great surprise!\n\nI absolutely LOVE how they make their dishes into these cute little tapa-sized containers.  It makes the place so much neater!!! \n\nAnd the dessert... ooh my gosh.  I almost died on the table from dessert-overdose.  They have these delicious chocolate and raspberry (or strawberry.. not sure) truffles that had me going back to the dessert section again and again.  \n\nOh, did I mention our waiter, and most of the other waiters, was pretty damn model-status? :P\n\nFor 27 bucks, this dinner buffet was very, very worth it!	If you're looking for a great dining experience during the holiday season, look no further than the dinner buffet deal at this restaurant. The tapa-sized containers make it easy to try a little bit of everything without feeling stuffed, and the dessert selection is so good, you might just overdose on sweets! But trust me, it's worth it. Overall, a great dining option for those looking for a festive and delicious meal.	1
"Object: Place (restaurant)

Key words: ranch, curt, wrong order, overcharged, customer service attitude.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"I was a regular here, I ordered frequently, because I loved their ranch. \nUsually the people who answered the phone were friendly and helpful. Though I ordered tonight, and some older guy answered. I could tell it was busy and he was rushing, but he was very curt and short while trying to place the order, he rushed every aspect like I couldn't talk fast enough for him. He didn't even give me my total before he said good bye and moved on to the next call. Then when the order arrived, it wasn't a half pepperoni/sausage, half pepperoni/mushroom pizza and mild wings as I ordered. Instead it was a half pepperoni, half pepperoni/mushroom/sausage pizza (which \""coincidentally\"" offers them an added cost for the same amount of toppings, just different arrangement) and PLAIN wings. When I called right after the driver left, the guy who took the order blamed the \""miscommunication\"" on me, then called me a liar about the wings, saying he \""tossed them himself\"". I even took a picture of the PLAIN wings for proof, but that was as far as he was willing to go; A regular customer got the wrong order because he was in a hurry, that customer was also over charged, and \""too bad\"", because he couldn't care less.\n\nIt's sad that I have to stop frequenting a place I loved, but if that is their new customer service attitude, I would rather not waste my money there."	I recently visited this place and had a terrible experience. The ranch dressing was stale and tasted old, the servers were curt and uninterested in helping me with my order, and to top it off, they got my order wrong. When I brought it to their attention, they overcharged me for the correct order and had a terrible customer service attitude about it. I would not recommend this place to anyone.	0
"Object: Sardine restaurant

Keywords: Madison, excellent, brunch, staff, 4 stars.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Update!  After living in Madison for two years, and now moving away... there is nothing quite like Sardine.  I looked back and saw that I had given it 4 stars... must have been an off day.  It's an all around excellent restaurant.  Brunch is most certainly the highlight, and the excellent staff is the icing on the cake.	I recently visited Sardine restaurant in Madison and had an excellent experience! The brunch menu was delicious and the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. I would give this restaurant 4 stars for their exceptional service and amazing food. Highly recommend checking it out!	1
"Object: performance/show
Key words: boring, small, stage, jokes, cheap tickets.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	"BORING!  I went there because Tropicana gave me free tickets.  Its a small dingy little performance room, with a barely cobbled together stage.  The guy gets a few laughs out - but is hardly original or witty.  Its more like 13 year old sex-based knock knock jokes.  \n\nWould not recommend anyone to waste their time watching this \""'show'\"" even if you get cheap tickets."	I recently attended a performance/show and I have to say, I was thoroughly disappointed. The show was incredibly boring and lacked any excitement or energy. The stage was so small that it felt cramped and there was no room for the performers to really showcase their talents. The jokes fell flat and were not entertaining in the slightest. To top it off, the tickets were cheap, which only added to the overall low-quality feel of the show. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this performance.	0
"Object: Hiking experience in Phoenix, Arizona
Key words: hiking, Phoenix, panoramic views, urban areas, sunset hike.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Who goes hiking on vacation?  Apparently I do!  Several friends that live in the area are always posting pictures of their hiking adventures around the Phoenix area and I wanted to see what desert hiking was all about when I came down for Memorial Day.\n\nBeing from the Pacific Northwest, hiking generally involves parading through heavily forested trails with occasional rockery and is often made worthwhile with scenic waterfalls and lakes.  I knew not to expect this in Arizona, but what I didn't realize was the different beauty Camelback provided.  Being located in basically the heart of the widespread greater Phoenix area, the panoramic views are unparalleled without being in a plane.  PNW hiking is generally situated far away from any urban areas so it was unique to be able to see an entire city and its surroundings from a hiking vantage point.\n\nIn hindsight I wish I would've brought a map of the Phoenix area (rather than looking at my small iPhone screen) to get an idea of what I was looking at across the valley.  As a golfer it was fun to see the layouts of the courses I've played from an aerial view, especially the Phoenician directly below on the south and east sides of the mountain.\n\nI'd love to come back for a sunset hike!	If you're looking for a truly breathtaking hiking experience, look no further than Phoenix, Arizona. The hiking trails in this urban area offer panoramic views that are truly awe-inspiring. But don't take my word for it - take a sunset hike and see for yourself! The combination of the stunning natural scenery and the vibrant cityscape is truly unforgettable. I highly recommend this hiking experience to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable adventure.	1
"Object: Thai restaurant in Arizona
Key words: Worst, sweet, lunch special, missing ingredients, wait staff, not recommended.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Worst Thai food  ever eaten in Arizona. The food were so sweet taste like dessert. Perhap the chef should eaten at a real Thai restaurant to know how real Thai food should taste like. We order the lunch special my $6.95 and my partner $10.75 because his came with soft drink. Ingredient were missing but wait staff failed to mentioned. When I told the waitress the ingredients on my plate are not what was describe on the menu. She just say oh sorry.\n\nWould never recommend this place to anyone. Wish I could give them zero star.	This Thai restaurant in Arizona is the worst one I've ever been to. Their sweet dishes were an absolute disaster and even their lunch specials were not worth the price. To make matters worse, some of the dishes were missing key ingredients, leaving us with subpar meals. The wait staff was slow and inattentive, making the experience even more frustrating. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.	0
"Object: New Zealand Cafe (restaurant)

Key words: 
1. Best sushi
2. Charlotte
3. Tiny
4. Delicious
5. Sushi bar
Specified sentiment: Positive"	This was, hands down, the best sushi I have ever had.  For that reason, it's no wonder locals tout New Zealand Cafe as having the best sushi in all of Charlotte!\n\nThe restaurant is a hole-in-the-wall in a somewhat dated strip mall.  It's very tiny with less than ten tables.  I went on a Saturday night and waited only two minutes before our party of two was seated at the sushi bar per our request.\n\nDespite it's size and location, the sushi is absolutely delicious.	If you're in Charlotte and looking for the best sushi in town, look no further than New Zealand Cafe! This tiny restaurant has a big reputation for serving up some of the most delicious sushi around. The sushi bar is where it's at - the chefs are true masters of their craft and make each roll with care and precision. Don't let the small size of this place fool you - the flavors are big and bold. The sushi here is truly a work of art. Highly recommend!	1
"Object: Cirque show based on Beatles music
Key words: solemn, explosive, acrobats, historical, amazing.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	From the beginning, I was floored. I've seen many of the other Cirque shows and each of them has a different flavor that I've found great appreciation for. In this show, it start off very solemn, then out of no where it EXPLODES. People running around the middle, acrobats literally falling from the sky. They wanted to start this one off with a bang, and they do an amazing job of it.\n\nSome of the characters take a little bit of knowledge regarding the time period Beatles music is set in as well as the historical events happening then. Beyond that, every song has something you can easily connect with.\n\nThe is one act which I still can't believe I saw. There is a guy on a platform at the top, and its rotating all the way round. He keeps doing these mid air jumps and staying on the platform without any wires. Crazy!\n\nWhether you're a Beatles fan or not, this performance will amaze you and be a great highlight of your Vegas trip.\n\nNOTE: Show is probably even better if you're drunk.	If you're looking for a show that's both solemn and explosive, look no further than the Cirque show based on Beatles music. The acrobats are truly amazing in their feats of strength and agility, and the historical context of the Beatles' music only adds to the overall experience. You won't be disappointed by this amazing performance.	1
"Object: Walmart's site-to-store option

Key words: wait time, service, staff, prices, delivery.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	NEVER use their site-to-store option at this store.  I've used it twice and both times the wait is over 30 minutes NOT because there's a line but because no one responds to the call for service at the desk!  What's more aggravating is that Walmart staff pass by the counter every few minutes but no one offers to help...and make the effort to ignore you.  \n\nCan we really blame them?  Is Walmart paying these people to care?  Prices are great...but at the expense of service.  I'd rather pay the extra $10 to get items delivered from now on if I'm unable to avoid shopping at Walmart!	I recently used Walmart's site-to-store option and was extremely disappointed with the experience. The wait time was incredibly long, and the service was lacking. The staff was unhelpful and seemed to be uninterested in providing good customer service. Additionally, the prices were not competitive, and I ended up paying more than I would have at other retailers. To make matters worse, the delivery was delayed, causing me to have to rearrange my schedule to pick up my items. Overall, I would not recommend Walmart's site-to-store option to anyone.	0
"Object: Eleven restaurant in Pittsburgh 

Key words: 
1. Reservations 
2. Private booth 
3. Knowledgeable waiter 
4. Beef tenderloin 
5. Chocolate peanut butter candy bar
Specified sentiment: Positive"	I was in Pittsburgh for my girlfriends birthday and wanted to take her out somewhere nice. After doing some research I came across Eleven and made reservations. I couldn't have been happier with the experience.\n\nI made the reservation on open table and noted that it was her birthday and requested any seating with a nice view or other differentiator if they had it. We walked in and were promptly seated in a nice private booth that overlooked the downstairs bar. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable. He checked on us often, but not too often. I also appreciated that he mentioned my girlfriends birthday without bringing out the waitstaff to sing or any other annoying show.\n\nThe food was excellent as well. They brought around breads, and the salt focaccia was delicious. I had the beef tenderloin and she had the roasted chicken. The beef was great and the fingerling potatoes that came with it may be the best potatoes I've ever had. I had a few bites of her chicken as well and it was equally as good. For desert we had the chocolate peanut butter candy bar and it was amazing. They even went out of their way and wrote happy birthday on a separate piece of chocolate for my girlfriend.\n\nOverall eleven was a great experience and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. A class act staff and delicious food.	I had the pleasure of dining at Eleven restaurant in Pittsburgh and it was an incredible experience! The reservation process was seamless and upon arrival, my party was seated in a lovely private booth. Our knowledgeable waiter made excellent recommendations and was able to answer all of our questions about the menu. The beef tenderloin was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. And for dessert, the chocolate peanut butter candy bar was the perfect way to end the meal. Overall, Eleven exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience.	1
"Object: La Salsa restaurant
Key words: service, server, bland food, Mexican Pizza, discount.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Hopefully this is the La Salsa next to M&M and Coke...\n\nRight off the bat, service was lacking starting with the hostesses. I didn't expect much though considering they're primarily known for their yard long margaritas. My server approached me and he pretty much made my trip worth it. His name is Javier and he's one of the nicest servers I've ever had, in general. \n\nI got the Mexican Pizza and chips, salsa, and guacamole. Simple.\nThe chips, salsa, and guacamole were so bland. I swear they got their salsa from a can. Literally, Pace brand salsa tastes 100 times better than this stuff. \n\nMexican Pizza was loaded with stuff but not anything special. I like the one at Taco Bell more. \n\nDessert was a chimi-cheesecake (sp?)? Sounded good but was eh. Fried stuff is pretty hard to mess up so it wasn't terrible.\n\nBest thing I consumed here was Coke.\n\nThe server was so nice to me though. He comped my dessert and gave me 15% off my bill. I didn't know I got a discount there (I work nearby). \n\nOf course, I gave him a mad tip. I was still disappointed at the terrible food.	I recently visited La Salsa restaurant and was highly disappointed with the service provided by the server. Not only did they seem disinterested in taking our order, but the food was extremely bland and lacked any real flavor. Specifically, the Mexican Pizza was a major letdown and did not meet my expectations at all. To make matters worse, when we asked about any available discounts, the server gave us a dismissive response and seemed annoyed by our inquiry. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for quality Mexican cuisine and attentive service.	0

The door guy is excepting $80 in cash for those willing to pay. Are you kidding me?

This establishment has everything you need to forget your worries and have a good time. ""The list"" may seem intimidating, but don't let that deter you - the door guy is friendly and helpful. And once you're inside, you'll be glad you made the effort. The atmosphere is cool and relaxed, with plenty of comfy couches to sink into. And don't worry about running into any douchebags - everyone here is just there to have a good time. Overall, I highly recommend checking out The W for a fun and stress-free night out."	1
"Object: Fremont's response to a negative review and lack of follow-up.

Key words: Fremont, response, negative ratings, rectify, customer satisfaction.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	As you can see below - there was a response from a Fremont Employee...after reading that, I PM'd more information that I thought would be helpful to jog the memory of those involved especially since this incident happened within 2 weeks - NO RESPONSE.  \n\nI think yelp is an important tool for consumers, who have many, many other choices.\n\nSO a big BOOO to you Fremont - for your canned response to negative ratings that you were quick to post for public view but when given the opportunity to rectify a situation (or at least make me feel warm and fuzzy again about your establishment again) in the name of customer satisfaction you were not interested since it would have been done privately.	Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with Fremont's response to my negative review. Instead of attempting to rectify the issue and improve customer satisfaction, they seemed indifferent and unresponsive. It's disheartening to see a company not take negative ratings seriously and not make any effort to address the concerns of their customers. I was left feeling unheard and unsatisfied with the lack of follow-up from Fremont.	0

I can't wait to go back for dinner with a nice bottle of something special :)	I recently had lunch at this amazing restaurant and I have to say, it was one of the best sushi experiences I've ever had! The sushi was incredibly fresh and delicious, and it was obvious that the ingredients were of the highest quality. What's even better is that it's a BYOB restaurant, so you can bring your own favorite drink to enjoy with your meal. The atmosphere was also very inviting and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this restaurant to any sushi lover out there!	1

Last nights take out made me decided to NEVER go back. The food was super greasy, bland to the point my family hesitated to eat it.  When I called the store, the manager told me \""her cooks have been cooking for over 15 years and could not have done anything wrong.\""  Sorry Lotus Cafe, but what you did do wrong was lose me as a good customer."	I recently visited Lotus Cafe and ordered some food, but I was extremely disappointed with my experience. The food was incredibly greasy and bland, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and unhealthy.

"Object: Boulders on Broadway bar
Key words: neighborhood bar, back patio, local beer choices, fair prices, small bites menu.
Specified sentiment: Positive"	Yep.  This place is as good as it gets.  When I lived in Tempe, Boulders on Broadway was my friendly neighborhood bar.  Now that I have a more permanent location in the Arcadia area this is where I go.  A quick bike ride up the 48th street greenbelt and im there! \n\nAs everyone says, the back patio is awesome.  I spend the majority of my time here.  Love seeing all the different dogs and love all the local beer choices.  I am currently drinking quite a bit of dragoon IPA which they seem to always have on tap.  The prices are fair and the food is great.  I like their small bites menu for late night munchies.  A couple beers split up with a pretzel makes for a good night.\n\n  If you have friends in town and want to show them a little local flavor, check this place out.  So many local beers and they also micro-brew in house.  The back patio shows off our great weather, their menu features local ingredients such as the yucca chips.  This place is the epitome of your local bar.	If you're looking for a great neighborhood bar to unwind after a long day, Boulders on Broadway is the place to be. With its cozy atmosphere and friendly staff, you'll feel right at home in no time. The back patio is a perfect spot to enjoy a local beer from their impressive selection of brews while taking in the fresh air. And let's talk about the food - their small bites menu offers a delicious range of options that won't break the bank. Plus, the prices are more than fair for the quality of the experience.

"Object: Hotel stay

Key words: Horrible customer service, dirty room, no cell phone service, broken A/C, dirty dishes.
Specified sentiment: Negative"	Horrible customer service.  Dirty room.  No cell phone service.\n\nChecked in at 4PM on a Friday.  Was told that we would get upgraded to a room with a view of the Las Vegas Strip.  More on this later.  That was a breeze.  Someone checks your room card to make sure you are a guest.  This makes the stay fancy, but sometimes there is a long line during busy times.\n\nThe room seemed nice.  View of the Las Vegas Strip I mentioned earlier?  Yeah.  I guess the hotel thinks looking down on the parking garage is a view of the Strip.  After unpacking, we noticed it was super hot in the bedroom.  The A/C was broken or something.  I closed the vent in the living room to re-direct all the air into the room.  Still nothing.  Put down the window shutter and that didn't help.  Mind you, it's a good 105 degrees outside with the sun beaming in.  We called and they said they'd said an engineer would come in.  Waited an hour and got fed up.  Went downstairs.  Had to wait in the long line.  Front desk just said they'll send up an engineer.  We go back up and we got a message about an engineer being there.  We called again and they'd send the engineer up again.  This took another 30 minutes.\n\nEngineer tinkered with something.  The room was still hot.  We called the front desk for a new room and they said they don't have any vacancies.  Oh really?  While waiting in the line to talk to the front desk, I checked the website and there were vacancies for all the rooms.  Hmm.  And cell phone service only exists downstairs.  Good luck trying to make a phone call or getting any important calls in your room.  Not happening at all.  Front desk said they can hook up the Internet manually since it's not showing up on the devices we wanted to connect to.  We just said forget about it.  What if we decided to pay $10/day or $20 for 3-days of Internet and it doesn't even work.  Then what?\n\nThe fridge was horrible.  It was not cooling anything at all.  Engineer said he'll see what he can do.  Never heard from him again.\n\nThe dishes in the cupboard?  Dirty.  The dish I pulled out was probably the only dirty one right?  Nope.  Few of them were.  Even the cups.  Yuck.  I'll post pictures of that.  It makes you want to rethink why they have checkout at 10AM to ensure that they clean everything thoroughly when it's just dirty.\n\nAlso, there was some person banging on our door at 7 in the evening.\n\nHorrible customer service.  Probably the first and last time staying here.  Heard good things about this hotel and that is why we stayed here.  Otherwise, after a horrible experience, will just go elsewhere.	I had an absolutely terrible experience during my recent hotel stay. The customer service was simply horrible, and I was treated with complete disregard when I tried to voice my concerns about the dirty room I was given. Not only was the room filthy, but there was no cell phone service available which made communication difficult. To add insult to injury, the air conditioning was broken and the room was uncomfortably hot. And to top it all off, I found dirty dishes left in the room from previous guests. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.	0
