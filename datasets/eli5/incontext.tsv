On 9/11, Why weren't the 2 planes headed for the twin towers shot down for being in restricted airspace? Or not shot down at all?	In the history of hijacking ,  the hijackers always held the passengers at bay for some ransom.  Freed prisoner, public statement, etc.   Then fly to some agreed safe airport and they'd release the passengers.      the goal before 9/11 was to protect the passengers onboard.     No one thought they didn't care about the passengers but were wanting the plane itself. Besides. Manhattan isn't restricted nofly space.  You can take helicopter rides of Manhattan.    The corridor along manhannttan is vfr airspace	On September 11, 2001, the hijackers had already taken control of the planes before they were even detected by air traffic control. The standard protocol for dealing with unauthorized planes in restricted airspace is to scramble fighter jets to intercept and if necessary, shoot them down. However, due to how quickly the attacks unfolded, there was not enough time for the military to respond and intercept the planes before they crashed into the World Trade Center towers. Additionally, there was likely reluctance to shoot down a passenger plane with innocent civilians on board, as the true nature of the attacks was not immediately clear.
"Why do we use the word ""corpse"" to describe a dead human body, but we use the word ""carcass"" to describe any other dead being?"	It's just an etymological idiosyncrasy. The French word for body is Corps, pronounced Core, with an extra e popping up from time to time basis on writing out the word. Carrion, which comes from Anglo-French and/or vulgar Latin, comes from Carione which is an adaptation of Caro or Carbo which means meat.  So in short it's just because a human body isn't considered meat, while the bodies of most everything else is. As far as I can find anyway.	"The use of the word ""corpse"" to describe a dead human body is believed to have originated from the Latin word ""corpus,"" which means body. On the other hand, the word ""carcass"" was originally used to refer to the bodies of dead animals that were hunted for food. Over time, the word came to be associated with the bodies of all dead animals, while ""corpse"" remained associated with dead humans."
Why is FMN considered a nucleotide?	Ribitol is still a sugar - it is actually classified as a “sugar alcohol” and is formed by the reduction of ribose but maintains its carbohydrate backbone.  Thus, FMN is nucleotide because, despite the slight difference between and sugar and a sugar alcohol, the key features of a nucleotide are still present.	FMN (flavin mononucleotide) is considered a nucleotide because it is composed of a ribose sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a flavin mononucleotide molecule. The flavin mononucleotide molecule contains nitrogenous bases, similar to those found in DNA and RNA nucleotides. Therefore, FMN is classified as a nucleotide, which is a building block of nucleic acids and energy-carrying molecules in living organisms.
why do tire treads lead to more traction when there is less surface area touching the road?	"They don't. That's why car racing often uses ""racing slicks"". The problem is that if you get even a little bit of something between the tire and the road (e.g. rain water) that there isn't anywhere for it to go, and it forms a film between the tire and the road that prevents the tire from getting any traction."	Tire treads lead to more traction because they increase the surface area that comes into contact with the road, allowing for better grip and friction. Although there may be less overall surface area touching the road with the treads, the design of the treads creates more edges and channels for the tire to grip the road, especially in wet or slippery conditions. This allows the tire to maintain better traction and control.
"What do people mean when they say ""there is more water underground than in the oceans""? Don't thought the oceans hold 95% of Earth's water?"	They're referring to drinkable water. There is a LOT of drinkable water underground. The largest supply of this currently in use would be in Libya, which is the home of the world's largest Aquifer (which was amusingly funded privately by the ruler of Libya who at the same time was also accepting massive amounts of money for aid from the UN). A laaaarge portion of that country is over a massive spring of water, which is why Libyans can have villages in places with no rivers, something many people found confusing until they discovered the reason why.	"Although the oceans do hold around 95% of the Earth's water, there is also a significant amount of water that exists underground in aquifers and other geological formations. This water is often referred to as groundwater and is estimated to be several times greater than the amount of water in all the world's rivers and lakes combined. So when people say ""there is more water underground than in the oceans,"" they are referring to the total amount of water on the planet, not just the water in the oceans."
Why do people park one or two car lengths back from the line at red traffic lights? {U.S.A. only, hopefully}	Drivers-Ed 101:  Leave enough room in front of you, so that in the event of getting rear-ended, you do not hit the person in front of you.  Remember, they teach you to be able to see the tires touching the pavement of the car in front of you. Stoplight?  In the event a chain reaction of rear-endings occur or someone just blasting you in the rear (that's what she said!), you will not go into the intersection - thus, not getting T-Boned and or killed. :) At least that's the justification I came to in the last 1 minute (Drivers Ed was 15 years ago, so I might be wrong).	In the U.S.A., it's common for people to park one or two car lengths back from the line at red traffic lights to allow for a buffer between their car and the car in front of them. This can be helpful in case the car in front of them has to back up suddenly or if they need to quickly move out of the way in case of an emergency. Additionally, it may also help to improve visibility and make it easier for other drivers to see past their car.
If dead tissue rots so quickly, how do clothes based on animal matter like leather or wool endure so long?	The reason things rot is that they are fed upon by bacteria and fungus. When you “tan” something, you make it poisonous to all of the things that would feed on it, so it never gets broken down and eaten and decayed. You do have to keep it oiled though, or it will dry up and turn to dust per time. I had a job where I worked with hundreds of years old leather, and that’s what would happen to it if not properly cared for.	Leather and wool endure longer than other animal-based materials because they undergo a special curing or tanning process that preserves the skins or fibers. Typically, the process involves removing water from the skins or wool, treating them with certain chemicals and oils, and then drying and conditioning them. This results in more durable and less susceptible fiber material that can withstand a lot of wear and tear. Additionally, the environment in which the clothing is stored can also affect its preservation. Dry conditions with low humidity can help to prolong the life of leather and wool clothing.
How do normal 3D glasses differ from IMAX 3D glasses and such?	3d glasses are meant to make your eyes see slightly different images so you have a sense of depth. The colored ones do this by having the two different images slightly tinted, and then the colored glasses filter out one from each side. The red eye doesn't see the blue image and vice versa. The imax ones make use of something called polarization, which is something many sunglasses have. Essentially it makes it so that only light that is oriented a particular direction can make it through the glasses. The left eye takes the up and down light, and the right eye the side to side light. This allows you to see two separate images without screwing the color	Normal 3D glasses use the traditional red-blue or red-green lenses that separate the left and right images to create a 3D effect. IMAX 3D glasses, on the other hand, use polarized lenses that filter the light waves and create a more realistic 3D effect. IMAX 3D glasses are also designed to fit more comfortably and sit closer to the face to provide a more immersive viewing experience. Additionally, some IMAX theaters use a dual-projection system that provides brighter and more vivid 3D images.
What's the difference between a bush, a shrub, and a tree?	Shrubs and trees are both specifically *woody* plants with stems that survive throughput the winter. A tree has a clear central trunk whereas a shrub has multiple stems rising from the ground. 'Bush' is a more general term for any plant with multiple stems rising from the ground, and that can be either woody or what's called herbaceous, herbaceous plants are ones where the stems die back completely or substantially in the winter leaving the plant with just its roots and new stems grow next spring.	A bush is a woody plant that typically grows low to the ground and often produces multiple stems. A shrub is also a woody plant with multiple stems, but it tends to be taller and more defined than a bush. A tree, on the other hand, has a single stem or a trunk, and it grows taller and larger in size than both bushes and shrubs.
How do athletes involved in extreme sports jump off cliffs without injury?	Generally they have either landing on something with some give to it (like snow), or with an incline to help redirect the force (like landing on a ramp), or they've got equipment that helps absorb some of the impact.  If you dropped a guy on a motocross bike out of a helicopter 30 feet onto a flat parking lot, he's going to have a really bad day. But if he takes that bike off a ramp 30 feet into the air, and then lands on another ramp on the way back down, it's not applying nearly the same acceleration and force on the bike and the rider.	Athletes involved in extreme sports usually use necessary safety equipments such as harnesses, ropes and helmets to help them jump off cliffs without getting injured. They also undergo extensive training and practice to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform these jumps safely. In addition, they often carefully assess the conditions, wind direction and speed, and take calculated risks to minimize the chances of injury. It's important to note that extreme sport athletes take high risks, and even with the necessary precautions, there is still a potential for injury or worse.
Why do all the people in the Old Testament live so long?	Because the bible had sections where it was really important to make genealogies. Where it was important to the story that such and such was an ancestor of so and so. And rather than have 400 people in between them it was easier to just have like 10 people which made them need to all be like 300 years old.	There are different theories regarding the long lifespans of people in the Old Testament. Some scholars propose that the ages were exaggerated or symbolic, while others suggest that the physical conditions and environment during that time may have allowed for longer lifespans. The Bible also suggests that God allowed for longer life during that period as a sign of His grace and favor towards humanity. Ultimately, the exact reason remains a subject of debate and interpretation.
How does a pulse width modulated digital to analog converter work?	The converter produces a pulse train at a fixed frequency, but with a variable ratio of on to off time. It is easy to manipulate the on/off ratio digitally, with good precision. Now consider the average value of the pulse train.     100% ON    full scale       50% ON    half scale         0% ON    bottom of scale So all that is needed is an averaging circuit to extract the analog value from the on/off ratio. It turns out that an analog averager is easy to build. This is a cheap form of DAC. Like anything cheap, it has its disadvantages. In this case, the problem is speed. By the time you have scaled down your clock rate to obtain the required resolution, then allowed for the lag of the averager, the speed of response is not good. For many applications this is acceptable.	A pulse width modulated digital to analog converter (PWM DAC) works by converting a digital signal into an analog voltage or current signal by rapidly switching a fixed voltage or current on and off in a controlled manner. The width (duration) of the pulses is proportional to the value of the digital signal. The analog output is then filtered to remove the high-frequency switching noise, leaving only the intended analog signal. PWM DACs are commonly used in audio applications such as amplifiers and speakers, as well as in motor control and power supplies.
The argument that lowering taxes on the rich will benefit the middle class	"The argument goes that taxing the rich less means the rich can invest more money which creates jobs, which would benefit the middle class. It's called ""trickle down economics"". However, it's quite clear it doesn't work. Lowering the taxes for the middle class is better strategy to aim for the same goal. Lower taxes for the middle class means they will have more money to spend, which creates more business opportunities and therefor creates more jobs. The power of the market comes from the people having spending power, not the rich having investing power. Because it's pointless for the rich to invest in making things when the people can't afford to buy said things."	The argument that lowering taxes on the rich will benefit the middle class is a controversial one. Proponents of this argument argue that when wealthy individuals and corporations have more money to invest in businesses and create jobs, economic growth will occur, resulting in more job opportunities and higher wages for the middle class. Critics, however, argue that this trickle-down economics theory has been debunked and that there is little evidence to support it. They argue that the benefits of tax cuts for the wealthy tend to stay within the upper echelons of society, with little to no positive effects on the middle and lower classes. Ultimately, the effectiveness of tax cuts for the rich in benefiting the middle class is subject to debate, and opinions differ depending on one's political and economic perspectives.
How long does it take to trace a phone call?	"Several minutes. Although I should clarify... that's several minutes of work for the person tracing it, not several minutes of keeping the caller talking. With today's all-digital networks, every part of the routing of a call is recorded somewhere - right down to the actual cell that the call originated from if it's a mobile. This information is held - there might be a minimum amount of detail required by law, but it's also held by the networks for a period, for engineering purposes. The ""Keep them on the line, we need 30 seconds to trace the call"" thing is purely something that Hollywood created to add tension when the kidnapper hangs up 29 seconds in."	It depends on the circumstances of the call tracing. If a law enforcement agency is involved and they have obtained a warrant or court order, the process could take anywhere from a few hours to several weeks, depending on various factors such as the technology used and the cooperation of telecom companies. If an individual is using software or tools to trace their own calls, the time it takes would depend on the sophistication of the tool and the ability to access and analyze the necessary data.
Why do our brains seem to have specific receptors just for drugs?	you have it backwards- random chemicals found in nature are drugs *because* they fit our receptors. Opium poppies don't have opiates in them on purpose, we purposefully grow opium poppies because we discovered *hey, this plant is full of  chemicals that do stuff*. Nicotine is present in tobacco because it's a poison, it kills many insects that would otherwise eat the plant.  Cannabis has THC in it either as an insecticide, a UV radiation buffer, or both, and we cultivate the plant because we discovered *hey this plant does something cool man*.  Plants are filled with complex chemicals for all kinds of different reasons, and such a large quantity of chemicals leads to a few that *just so happen* to fit chemical receptors in our brains.	Our brains have specific receptors for drugs because these receptors are designed to interact with naturally occurring neurotransmitters in our brains. Drugs such as opioids, marijuana, and LSD, for example, bind to our brains' receptors known as cannabinoid, opioid, and serotonin receptors, respectively. These drugs mimic the effects of naturally occurring neurotransmitters and can cause various physiological and psychological effects. Over time, drug use can also change the brain's chemistry and the way these receptors function, leading to addiction and other negative consequences.
When your mouth is wide open you breath out hot air but if your lips are in the same position as if you were about to whistle you breath out cold air?	The sensation of temperature  comes from the speed at which your body loses its heat to the environment. A mouth that's almost closed will speed up the air which travels through it. Fast moving air means that the skin (of a finger feeling temperature) is constantly exposed to new air capable of heating up from contact.  Try this as an experiment: close your mouth as if whistling, but blow very slowly. Conversely, open your mouth wide and make one rapid push.	No, the temperature of the air you exhale does not change depending on whether your mouth is wide open or your lips are pursed as if to whistle. The temperature of the air you exhale will be constant and determined by the temperature inside your body. However, if the air is passing over your tongue, it may feel cooler if your mouth is more closed because your saliva can evaporate and create a cooling sensation.
Is fear something one can be conditioned to?	Actually, the only real treatment to specific phobias is exposure therapy. So, fear conditioning is not only possible, but also the only confirmed treatment to phobias. And the earlier you start the conditioning, the higher will be the probability of achieving the cure. No amount of drugs can help you with fear. Phobias are anxiety disorders and anxiolytics can help you cope with some crisis, but that's all they do, you won't be treated. TL;DR: Yes.	Yes, fear can be conditioned. Through experiences or associations, a person can learn to associate certain stimuli or situations with fear and develop a fear response to them. This process is known as classical conditioning. For example, a person may develop a fear of flying after experiencing turbulence on a previous flight. The fear response can also be reinforced through operant conditioning, where a person learns to avoid certain behaviors that may lead to a fearful outcome.
how come alcohol is so toxic to bacteria it sterilizes things instantly and no bacteria is able to become immune to it it seems, and yet its toxicity is so low to us we ingest it for pleasure?	Everything on Earth is poisonous if you ingest too much of it.  The question is what constitutes a lethal dosage.  A very small organism, such as a bacteria, can be killed with a relatively small amount of alcohol.  A larger organism, like a human, requires a larger dose.  We also have organs like the liver that help process the poison out of our bodies.  So even if the alcohol doesn’t hurt a human, it does kill bacteria in your mouth on the way down. The thing is, alcohol DOES hurt humans.  A lot.  You know how people vomit when they become intoxicated?  That’s the body’s way or recognizing that it ingested too much of an unpleasant substance and needs to expel it from the body.  If a person drinks too much in one sitting, they absolutely will die.  If a person drinks large amounts over time, it will damage the liver and can lead to other health problems.	Alcohol is toxic to bacteria because it can penetrate their cell walls and disrupt their metabolic processes. Bacteria do not have the same protective mechanisms as humans and are unable to metabolize or eliminate alcohol as efficiently, which leads to cell damage and eventually death.  However, humans have evolved to metabolize alcohol through the liver and can tolerate small amounts without much harm. The toxicity of alcohol is dose-dependent, so while large amounts may be harmful or even lethal, small amounts can produce pleasurable effects with minimal adverse effects. This is why alcohol is used recreationally in many cultures.
Why do you get chills/goosebumps from hearing large crowds sing along to songs?	I think it's because, at that moment, it's basically a large number of people all of the same mind and thinking and saying the same thing, which is an astonishing thing if you think about it.  As a performing musician myself, the biggest rush I get on stage is when people start singing along to the song and, after the initial mismatch in their tempo and volume, they all synchronize and the whole place resonates. That feeling of collective output is an amazing feeling and it really gives you a strong sense of fraternity and belonging, knowing that all the people around you are passionate about the same thing.  If that's not enough to give a person goosebumps, I'm not sure what is.	When you hear a large crowd singing along to a song, it can trigger an emotional response in your brain that releases dopamine and endorphins. This can lead to a physical sensation of pleasure or excitement, which can manifest in the form of chills or goosebumps. Additionally, when you hear a familiar song that you enjoy being sung by a group of people, it can create a sense of belonging and connectedness, which can also contribute to the emotional and physical response.
How to explain depression to my spouse who believes it's not a real disease and can be controlled by deciding to not be sad.	Go to a counselor/psychologist along with your spouse. You speak to the counselor first and explain your situation and then let the counselor speak to your spouse and explain why depression should be taken seriously. When a person is depressed, the immediate family also needs counseling on how to handle the situation. If someone gives you tough-love or compares your issues with someone else's, just ignore them.	It can be difficult to explain depression to someone who believes it's not a real disease. You could try using an analogy to help them understand. For example, you could compare depression to a physical illness, such as diabetes. Just as diabetes affects the body's ability to produce insulin, depression affects the brain's ability to regulate mood. And just as diabetes requires medical treatment, depression often requires a combination of therapy and medication to manage.  It's important to explain that depression is not something that can be controlled simply by deciding to not be sad. It's a complex condition that can affect a person's ability to function, and it requires professional help to manage. You could also share resources or articles on depression and its symptoms so that your spouse can have a better understanding of what you're going through.
