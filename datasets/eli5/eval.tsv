Why is liquid almost always stored in round containers on trucks?	I'm not an engineer, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's because in a round container, as the fluid level drops, the liquid will always be in the bottom and center of the container. If the container had a rectangular base, liquid could get stuck in the corners, which would make it tougher to drain the container.	Liquid is almost always stored in round containers on trucks because they are the most stable and efficient shape for transportation. Round containers distribute weight evenly and have no corners or edges for the liquid to become trapped and slosh around, which could cause instability and potentially dangerous situations on the road. Additionally, round containers allow for easy filling and emptying without wasted space, making them a cost-effective choice for transportation companies.
What happens when herbivore animals are raised on meat?	They would probably just die quite fast, because their digestive system wouldn't be able to properly break down the food, and even if it could, the body wouldn't be getting the required vitamins and minerals to function. Thats assuming you could get it to eat the food, and the digestive system doesn't outright reject the meat.	Herbivore animals are not naturally adapted to digest and metabolize meat as their primary source of nutrition. Feeding them a diet high in meat can cause digestive problems, nutrient imbalances, and potentially impact their health and growth. It can also alter their natural behavior and feeding patterns, leading to stress and discomfort. For ethical and health reasons, it is important to feed herbivore animals a balanced diet that meets their nutritional needs, as well as their natural feeding habits.
"What happens and why when something makes us ""jump""?"	"Being confronted with a very sudden and unknown sensory assault, like a sudden very loud noise, activates a specific part of your nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system.  This system is hard-wired to turn on the notorious ""fight-or-flight"" response.  Basically, the sympathetic nervous system is preparing your body for extreme exertion and possible trauma.  My favorite analogy, given to me by a professor: ""think about what your body does and does not need when you are running away from a tiger.  you need your blood pumping, your muscles primed, your lungs breathing hard.  you don't need to waste energy on eating or digesting."" When you are in this mode, your heartrate increases, you start to breath faster, your blood pressure increases (in order to supply more blood to both your muscles and your brain).  Your digestive system pretty much shuts down, which explains why you don't feel hungry when you're very anxious.  Your body diverts blood from your skin to the muscles, which explains why you feel cold and sweaty, and why your palms get blotchy.  your adrenal glands have shot norepinephrine and epinephrine (basically adrenaline) into your system and helped to modulate all of these systems.  There are also some more complicated metabolic mechanisms going on, that might be a little too much to get into here, but basically your liver starts to break down all of it's stored up sugar, and your muscles start to take it in.  All of these systems, and many other effects I haven't mentioned, are affected when you are nervous or anxious, and if you are chronically anxious, they can have a negative effect on your health.  That's why constant ""stress"" can have a visible impact on a person."	"When something makes us ""jump,"" it is because our body's natural ""fight or flight"" response has been triggered. This response is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares the body to deal with perceived threats by increasing heart rate, respiration, and muscle tension. When something startles or surprises us, our brain perceives it as a potential threat and signals the body to respond accordingly. This can cause us to physically jump or startle, as a reflexive action to protect ourselves."
What part of the fracking process makes it so bad for the environment?	I'm going to actually ELI5 here. Fracking by itself is actually not bad as long as we do it in the right places. Frac fluid is usually a combination of water, lubricants and sand. The sand keeps the cracks we form open, the lubricants and other additives help deal with the mechanics of pumping fluid to high enough pressure to actually crack the rock. The water is there as a solvent (mix everything into it). Fractures are unpredictable, typically they will travel along naturally weak parts of the rock. In many cases this is actually horizontally (flat for you 5 year olds) since most hydrocarbons we frack for (oil and gas) occur in sedimentary rocks like sandstone and more recently shale. These rocks are more or less deposited over time in big flat sheets, I'm not going to get into structures like anticlines, faults or domes except that sometimes a frack will travel along a natural fault line. Now lets look at how a typical oil or gas well is constructed. There are typically at least 2 (if not 3 or 4) pipes put into the ground. The first one is called the surface casing. In most civilized parts of the world this is set in competent (stable) rock well below the lowest water bearing aquifer and cemented in place. Then we sometimes have 1 or more intermediate casings that run down to where we want to produce our oil or gas from. Since most wells are horizontal now this means this string of casing runs down right into the production unit and is also cemented in place by forcing cement down the well and up the sides of the casing. When done properly this provides two layers of protection to the water table. Then you run what is called the production liner. This is another string of pipe that has holes in it ONLY WHERE WE PLAN ON PUMPING OIL OR GAS.  So now that we have that background let's examine where it is OK to frack and where we should probably be worried. In deep deposits such as those found in the foothills of the Rockies in Canada (WCSB) fracking will NEVER contaminate the ground water UNLESS the drilling contractor did not properly set and cement those casings or the casing breaks for some reason. This is why I prefer to drill with at least one intermediate casing. In shallow gas areas such as the Eastern US sometimes there is no room to set the surface casing deep enough to make it into a solid rock formation so they end up cementing casing in loose (highly permeable) rock that doesn't protect anything. Other times the fractures can actually travel far enough upwards to penetrate into the aquifer which is a whole new type of problem because we can't even pretend to know where the source of contamination is. TL:DR Fracking by itself is not bad. Most issues arise from improper construction of the well above the fractured zone.	Fracking can have a negative impact on the environment due to several factors. One of the main concerns is the contamination of groundwater and soil from the chemicals used in the fracking fluid, as well as the release of methane gas during the drilling and extraction process. Fracking also requires enormous amounts of water, which can lead to increased water usage and depletion in areas with limited water resources. The disposal of wastewater from the fracking process can also result in environmental damage if not handled properly. Additionally, the construction of fracking infrastructure such as well pads, access roads, and pipelines can cause habitat fragmentation and other disturbances to wildlife and natural landscapes.
How doe home owner associations have any power?	It's one of the contingencies in a home sale contract. There is a list of things that the seller must disclose to the buyer of a house before the contract is signed. One of those is a contract from the H/POA (Home/Property Owners Association) or Condominium operator. It varies state to state, but generally they(the POA) has a given window of time to present the rules and regs/fees/etc to the potential buyer. If the buyer does not find them agreeable, it's actually one of the few things you can walk out of a home sale contract on. If you do not agree to the terms, you don't buy the house.  Sometimes to rules not only cover what goes on while you live there, but also what happens if you sell it. My wife and I are house shopping now and there are a number of different POAs we've looked into and some go as far as saying if you try to sell, you have to first put it up on a private POA only listing for like 45 days before putting it on the open market. Furthermore, even if the buyer agrees to the POA agreement, they (the POA) can still deny the sale. Not entirely sure the legal grounds there, but there ya go.  So long story short: You follow their arbitrary rules because you signed a contract saying you would. Some agreements are better than others, so read them carefully.	Homeowner associations (HOAs) have power because they are established contracts between residents within a community that outlines the rules and regulations of living in that area. HOAs may have the power to enforce rules by imposing fines or penalties on residents who violate the regulations, and they may also have the authority to make decisions on behalf of the community, such as assessing and collecting fees to fund repairs or improvements to common areas. The power of HOAs is typically outlined in the association’s bylaws, and homeowners agree to be bound by these rules when they purchase property in the community.
How is it safe/ sanitary not to wash black cast iron cookwear between uses?	For starters you don't leave a cast iron pan filthy simply because you don't want to use soap on one. You scrub it out quite thoroughly to get rid of any food remains. It should still be a smooth, clean pan when you put it away. Since the surface of the pan is minimal, there isn't much of a feeding medium for bacteria to grow on. Especially since you quite frequently use the pan and heat it to the point where any bacteria present die. If there's any particularly persistent food remains in your pan, get some coarse salt. Pour a little salt in and use the salt as an abrasive as you scrub out the pan with some kitchen paper.	It is not recommended to use black cast iron cookware without washing it between uses as this can lead to the accumulation of harmful bacteria and food particles. Washing with warm water and soap followed by a thorough drying and seasoning with oil after each use maintains the safety and longevity of the cookware.
"Does our brain ""render"", or ""run"" dreams in ""real-time""?"	"Your external senses are connected to specific centers in your brain that process the external signals and create the conscious sensation of seeing, hearing etc. These would be the ""renderers"". When you're imagining, dreaming or hallucinating, it means that an internal signal from your brain is stimulating those areas to create the sensation. For instance, you can visualize an image in your mind because it's stored in your memory as a stimulus that, when run into your visual cortex, recreates the sensation of seeing that image. When you do this consciously, you know that it's just a mental image and not a real one. But when you're dreaming/hallucinating, you usually can't consciously differentiate, so you have the impression it's a real image."	"The brain does not ""render"" or ""run"" dreams in real-time like a computer program. Dreams are a complex and still not fully understood neurological phenomenon that occurs during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. It is believed that the brain activity during REM sleep is similar to waking brain activity, and that dreams are constructed from pieces of memories, emotions, and sensations that are experienced and processed during the day. However, the experience of time in a dream can be distorted and may feel longer or shorter than it actually is."
How do WIFI waves travel through walls?	It's sort of the same as asking: how does visible light travel through windows? Every single material has certain wavelengths of light they are allowed to absorb. If this were not true then windows would be completely opaque! So in the same idea, certain materials are unable to absorb radio waves, so these waves can travel right through without much problem since the chemical bonds and atoms don't want to absorb it since they can only allow discrete (specific) values of energy to be absorbed.	WIFI waves, also known as radio waves, travel through walls by passing through the material or being reflected by it. The extent to which WIFI waves can pass through walls depends on the material of the wall and its thickness. Some materials, such as brick and concrete, can significantly weaken the signal strength, while other materials, such as drywall, allow WIFI waves to pass through more easily.
Why charities with similar goals don't merge to become more effective?	Merging companies (and yes, non-profits are companies) requires a lot of work. First, just because two companies do the same thing does not mean that they could merge easily. What if one is a Catholic charity, and the other is non-religious? Is the new charity religious or not? Which of the two Presidents is going to be in charge? Are you going to fire a bunch of staff? If not, how is it more efficient to have 1 big company with twice as many workers? Companies merge when it makes some financial sense. Since non-profits are not in it to maximize value, they don't have to worry about being the biggest and best.	Charities with similar goals may not always merge for various reasons. Some charities may have different approaches to achieving their goals or may have different philosophies or strategies in how they operate their organizations. Merging two distinct charities can also require significant resources and might involve complex negotiations over issues such as leadership, staffing, and fundraising. Additionally, charities might prefer to maintain their independence and preserve their unique identity, rather than joining forces with another organization. However, in some cases, charities may collaborate or form partnerships to achieve shared goals and maximize their impact.
how come there are no absolute points in space?	"That's a misconception: what we observe is that all points are expanding from all points.  From Earth it looks like everything is moving away from us, but from anywhere else it looks the same way, too. Since we haven't found an ""edge"" or ""center"" of the universe, there's no absolute way to reference any point in relation to the universe itself.  The best we can do is reference a point in relation to some other point (distance from Earth, from the Sun, from our galaxy, etc.). The simple illustration I have read a lot is to draw dots on the surface of a balloon and inflate it.  All the dots move apart from each other, and on the surface of the balloon itself, that expansion is uniform: it's not one part of the rubber expanding out, but rather the whole thing expanding."	There are no absolute points in space because the position of an object in space depends on the point of reference chosen. In other words, space is relative and not fixed. This concept is explained by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, which suggests that space and time are interdependent and can only be measured relative to each other. Therefore, there can be no absolute or fixed reference point in space.
Why should I care about NSA spying me?	It's the principle of the matter. The vast majority of citizens don't have anything to hide or anything in phone/internet records that the NSA would find interesting. But that's not the point. The point is, as Americans, we are supposed to be entitled to certain things, like the right to privacy, right to be free from unwarranted searches and seizures. These rights are being taken away from us because without them we are supposedly safer. This may be the case, and there may not be any other hidden agenda other than truly to make the U.S. population safer. But taking away one right, and chipping away at our constitutional freedoms just a little bit every once in awhile, slowly adds up over time. It also allows for more control and more extreme laws to be passed because we the people would simply have no more justification for questioning our government and elected (or maybe in the future, unelected) officials. If there's no laws in place protecting our rights that we enjoy (and take for granted everyday), how could we then argue against things like abuses of power and corruption in the government? Say hypothetically, next our 1st Amendment right to free speech is taken away? Well, now you have a situation in which the government can record all of your communications and you do not have the right to speak freely. If you cant speak and communicate freely, you begin to loose your ability to think freely because exchanging of varying ideas and viewpoints becomes harder to do and it becomes harder to learn the truth about the world or form any of your own opinions because information is lacking. Yes, this is not necessarily likely or going to happen in our case, and somewhat paranoid. It is a worst case scenario, but it can and has happened in the past. The more power a group of people has over another group, the more likely they are to abuse that power! It has been proven time and time again throughout history and even through sociological and psychological experiments. Our constitutional rights are all we have to keep powerful people in check and keep them on a moral, lawful and justifiable path. All it takes is a couple slip ups, and power hungry and radical people can have too much control which is potential disaster. Basically, my point is that we are a Democratic Republic. We each have the right to participate in government, being that in theory we elect a few of ourselves to run our government. We therefore need to watch those in power, as much as they watch us to keep them in check.  The NSA spying thing may be simply innocent now, but whos to say it isnt used for the wrong reasons in the future?	You may want to care about NSA (National Security Agency) spying on you as it can impact your privacy and personal information. The collection of your data by the NSA could potentially be used to monitor your online activities, track your movements, or access your sensitive information without your consent. This raises concerns about government surveillance and the extent of their reach into our private lives. Additionally, it may violate your constitutional rights, such as the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens against intrusive searches and seizures.
Can the capacity of our brains be roughly measured in bytes?	"Computer storage and the human memory are not directly comparable. Computers store information as states of ""on"" or 1s and ""off"" or 0s. A single one or zero is a bit, and 8 of these put together (at least in most modern computers) is a byte. But brains don't work like that at all. We store memories as connections between nerve cells, so bytes is not a very applicable unit to measure brain capacity with. A more accurate measure of brain capacity is the number of connections in the brain."	No, the capacity of our brains cannot be measured in bytes because the way information is stored in our brains is vastly different from how information is stored in computer memory. The brain doesn't use a binary code that comprises 1s and 0s to store information. Instead, the brain uses a complex network of neurons and synapses to form and recall memories, which cannot be quantified in terms of bytes. Additionally, there is no scientific consensus on how to measure the capacity of the human brain.
It's Sunday night during winter and a storm starts dumping snow all over the roads, what is going on behind the scenes to get all the roads cleared for Monday morning?	I have moved to a rich little town this year (no I am not rich) and I have been absolutely AMAZED at what they do to clear out the snow.  It is a very small town but there is literally a fleet of plows at work the entire time it is snowing.  In my little neighborhood which has maybe 3 dozen houses (on large lots) I swear there were up to three plows at a time and they literally went by like once an hour.  They would spend time waiting until there was a little snow built up.  As far as I know the same thing was happening at the same time all over town.  THEN when there was snow built up from shoveling and plows in the main part of the town they brought in dumpsters and those bucket construction vehicles and literally scooped up the extra snow and hauled it away never to be seen again.	Behind the scenes, a team of professionals is likely monitoring the storm's progress and preparing their snow removal equipment. This may include snow plows, salt trucks, and other specialized vehicles designed to clear roads and make them safe for travel. The team may be coordinating with local authorities, such as police or emergency responders, to ensure that priority roads are cleared first. Crews may work throughout the night to clear snow and ice from roads and make them safe for commuting. Additionally, if the snowfall is particularly heavy, crews may be dispatched to remove snow from public areas such as sidewalks, parking lots, and bus stops.
if companies can put weird apps on your web-browser for advertisements and search engines, why cant they auto install key loggers?	"They can.  That's why you should not install applications from sources you do not trust. That is why the OS prompts you and says ""Do you want to allow this application to make changes to you PC?""  If an install is not doing anything that carries that risk, that warning will not pop up.   The single most important thing you can do to protect yourself on any computing device is as simple as this:  Read the dialog box.  Think. Answer the question."	Auto installing key loggers would violate user privacy and potentially harm their security. Key loggers can access sensitive information such as login credentials and financial data, making them a tool for malicious intent. As such, they are generally considered malware and are typically prohibited by the terms of service of browsers and operating systems. Additionally, auto installing key loggers without the user's consent would be an illegal activity and subject to prosecution.
where do the terms political left and right come from?	"The terms ""left"" and ""right"" appeared during the French Revolution of 1789 when members of the National Assembly divided into supporters of the king to the president's right and supporters of the revolution to his left. One deputy, the Baron de Gauville explained, ""We began to recognize each other: those who were loyal to religion and the king took up positions to the right of the chair so as to avoid the shouts, oaths, and indecencies that enjoyed free rein in the opposing camp."" However the Right opposed the seating arrangement because they believed that deputies should support private or general interests but should not form factions or political parties. The contemporary press occasionally used the terms ""left"" and ""right"" to refer to the opposing sides. - Wilkipedia"	"The terms ""political left"" and ""political right"" originated during the French Revolution in the late 18th century. During this time, those who sat on the left side of the National Assembly were generally associated with political radicalism and advocating for change, while those on the right were associated with conservatism and upholding traditional values. Since then, these terms have been applied to political ideologies across the world."
Why don't sharks, fish, and other aquatic animals need to equalize whenever they ascend or descend through water?	This is a complex question.  Humans can get 3 major problems when diving.  1) the bends (nitrogen bubbles forming when you come up), 2) nitrogen narcosis (too high nitrogen levels in the blood), 3)  barotrauma (rupture of air filled spaces like your sinus or lungs when you come up as gases expand). The air we breathe is mostly nitrogen (78%) but our body doesn’t use it (unlike oxygen which cells can use in metabolism).  That’s why most of the problems relate to nitrogen as opposed to oxygen or carbon dioxide. When you go down to depth,  air is compressed by the pressure.   In other words, the molecules of air (mostly nitrogen) are packed tighter together.  So more of them will fit in your lungs and sinus.  When you come up, they expand and cause barotrauma.  Similarly, more molecules will dissolve in your blood, at depth, high nitrogen levels make you feel drunk (nitrogen narcosis) and when you come up, they come out of the blood in bubbles (the bends) which damages nerves.   Sea creatures like seals and whales are mammals that can descend quickly and come up and breathe the air just as we do.  However they have adaptive mechanisms to compensate for the change.  Their lungs compresses (and most of the oxygen is stored in the blood instead of the lungs so they can stay down longer).  That way, their lungs cannot explode when they come up (e.g. there’s no air in them to expand).   It also eliminates the store of extra nitrogen (which humans have in the scuba tank) that could potentially be absorbed in the blood to cause nitrogen narcosis.  The ones that have sinuses have large Eustachian tubes that keep the sinus the same pressure as the outside world (we have this too, but they get easily blocked like when you come down in a plane).    Fish, don’t have lungs or sinuses (generally) or they have other adaptive mechanisms (like a bed of blood vessels that engorges at depth to fill an air filled space).   The general answer would be, that they have a series of adaptive mechanisms that prevent barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis and the bends.	Marine animals like sharks, fish, and whales have a specialized organ called a swim bladder, which helps them control their buoyancy and prevent the need for equalization during ascent or descent. Additionally, these animals have adapted to the pressure changes associated with swimming at different depths, and their bodies have evolved to handle these changes without harm.
What are bed covers (not fitted sheets) used for?	You have the fitted sheet that goes on the bed to protect it from your sweat and oils. You then have the top sheet that goes over you to protect your blankets from your sweat and oils. You then have however many blankets, quilts, and comforters you want to use.  I have never heard of a bed cover and do not know what that product is. It is either you misnaming the top sheet, or it is a decorative cover put on beds to protect them from dust.	Bed covers, also known as comforters, duvets, or quilts, are used to keep you warm and cozy while you sleep. They are typically made of thick material and come in a range of styles, colors, and patterns to suit your personal preferences and home decor. Additionally, they can add an extra layer of softness and cushioning to your mattress, helping to create a more comfortable sleeping surface.
Why do we enjoy things like rocking chairs/swings/gliders seemingly from birth through old age?	As far as I'm aware, slow rocking or swaying is connected to human perception of a moment length of time, which comes from the length of a breath. Moving back and forth at a rate similar to that feels natural like breathing and so we find it relaxing. Faster movement like on swings is fun thanks to the adrenaline release.	There are a few reasons why people enjoy rocking chairs, swings, and gliders throughout their lives. One reason is that the rhythmic motion can have a calming and soothing effect on the body and mind, reducing stress and promoting relaxation. Additionally, the sensation of movement can be pleasant and enjoyable for many people. Finally, rocking chairs, swings, and gliders can provide a sense of nostalgia and comfort, reminding people of happy memories from their childhood or other comforting experiences.
Why does it ask if I'm Hispanic/Latino in a separate question from my race on job applications, surveys, etc?	Because Hispanic/Latino is not a race, and arguably not even an ethnicity; rather, it is a cultural affiliation, largely related to the Spanish language and the cultures of the Latin American countries. Hispanic/Latinos can be of any race; most who emigrate to the US are Native American, most often with a mix of White ancestry. But, since they identify more strongly with each other than with non-Hispanic/Latino people of these races, it makes sense to group them together.	The reason for this is that being Hispanic/Latino is considered an ethnicity, while race refers to physical characteristics such as skin color, hair texture, and facial features. The US government requires companies and institutions to collect data on both race and ethnicity to ensure equal opportunities and protect against discrimination. By separating the two categories, more detailed and accurate data can be collected to measure diversity and identify potential disparities.
how would copyright affect fan made content using images from online?	You can't take images you don't have a right to use, put them on something, and then sell it. This isn't a fair use situation.   >  the other side argues that as long as he doesn't claim ownership, and doesn't include the title, he would be fine, and that other people at conventions do the same(pulling things off the internet, making things from them, selling them). It's not about claiming ownership. Copyright gives you control over how things are distributed. You can't just scrub the title and sell things when everybody else would have to pay for a license. Those people at conventions are likely infringing on copyright. Everybody downloads music for free off the internet, but that doesn't make it legal to share music. It's one thing if your friend made an homage to an anime character by himself. It's another if he just copied and pasted images off the internet.	Copyright law states that using images without permission from the copyright owner is considered infringement. Therefore, if someone uses images without permission to create fan-made content, they may be infringing on the copyright holder's rights. However, there may be exceptions or defenses to copyright infringement, such as fair use or transformative use. It's important to consult with a legal professional to determine the legality of using images for fan-made content.
Why do some sodas (like Coke) produce a lot of foam when it's poured into a cup, from say, a can, while other sodas (like Sprite) don't produce nearly as much?	"the most important factor in how ""foamy"" a soda acts is which of its ingredients raise or lower surface tension. Aspartame promotes the formation and persistence of bubbles, as do certain preservatives. The combination of multiple foam-promoting ingredients and circumstance is why Diet Coke reacts so energetically with Mentos candy."	The amount of foam produced when pouring a soda can depend on various factors, including the carbonation level, temperature, and viscosity of the drink. Coke has a higher carbonation level compared to Sprite, which could explain why it produces more foam. Additionally, if the soda is poured too quickly or at an angle, it can also result in increased foaming.
Why are SSNs so damn insecure?	They started issuing these numbers in 1936, and they were only intended to be your account number for your social security benefits.  That's it.    Everything else that has happened with them since then is an unauthorized use.   But there have been so many unauthorized uses that the government finally just gave up and let people do whatever they wanted with them. So like Drafterman said, they weren't ever intended to be secure.	SSNs are considered insecure because they are often used as a form of identification by various organizations, including financial institutions and government agencies. They were originally intended solely for Social Security and tax-related purposes, but over time they have become more widely used for other purposes. Additionally, SSNs are often printed on physical documents such as drivers licenses and insurance cards, making them vulnerable to theft and fraud.
What gives police the right to confiscate cameras that recorded an incident involving the police?	"Technically, the Police do not have ""rights,"" citizens do. Police have ""Authority."" Big difference. In any case, they CAN take your camera to ""preserve evidence,"" such as if you film a crime (usually only applies to major crimes). Should you refuse, they can legally detain you for a short time while they acquire a subpoena or a warrant to confiscate the camera. They still need a warrant regardless, but if the evidence is serious enough, it isnt too difficult to obtain one.  Of course, if you are worried about police abuse, and them confiscating your camera to destroy evidence of their wrong doing, there are several apps and such for smart phones that can upload a video online or store it until you can retrieve it later."	In general, police can only confiscate cameras under specific circumstances and with a valid legal reason, such as obtaining evidence of a crime. However, the collection of evidence must be done in accordance with the law and must not infringe on the rights of individuals. It is always recommended to seek the advice of an attorney if you believe your rights have been violated in such situations.
Is there a technical limit to how big can the human strength and muscles get? Or is it indefinite as long as we always provide all the necessary nutrition and workout?	You can only apply as much force as your ligaments and tendons can withstand. They do get thicker with muscle growth but they also have to not rip off their attachments to the bone. I'm not sure if ligaments, tendons, and attachment points grow at the same rate as the muscle since steroid facilitated muscle growth can be fairly rapid.      But eventually strength is proportional to cross sectional area. Mass is proportional to volume. Eventually you would get so heavy you wouldn't be able to lift your limbs or yourself. This at the incredible hulk and beyond stage.	There are limits to how big human muscles can get, and these are largely determined by genetics. While providing adequate nutrition and engaging in regular exercise can certainly help one to reach their full potential, there is only so much that can be achieved naturally. Additionally, pumping up muscles beyond a certain point can lead to negative health consequences, such as joint damage and increased risk of injury.
how race cars and street racing cars can rev their engines without moving forward.	"First you have your engine.  Your engine is running and using fuel to produce power from the second you turn the key in your ignition.  It doesn't move the entire car forward unless you connect the engine to the wheels.  This is what your transmission is for. Two kinds of transmissions available.  One where you manually choose which gear to drive in, this is called a manual, stick-shift or standard transmission (all interchangeable)  It's also common to hear someone refer to their transmission by how many gears it has, don't be confused by this either.  If you hear someone say they have a ""5 speed truck""  they are MOST LIKELY referring to a 5 speed manual transmission, I wouldn't recommend referring to an automatic transmission by it's speeds because the driver has very little to do with those gears and you'll only cause confusion with whoever you're talking to.   Automatic transmissions are very common now, if you DON'T know what type of transmission you have I GUARANTEE you have an automatic.  Automatic transmissions decide your gear for you based on programing.   Either way, as long as the transmission isn't engaged (by say putting your vehicle in drive, or reverse), and is in neutral you can feed the motor all the gasoline you can afford and it will run as hard and as fast as it was built to, but you won't be moving forward because that power is being wasted and not being transferred to your wheels by your transmission."	"Race cars and street racing cars can rev their engines without moving forward by disengaging the clutch while pressing on the accelerator pedal. This allows the engine to rev up without the power being transmitted to the wheels. Some cars may also have a feature called ""neutral revving"" where the car is put in neutral and the engine is revved for a short period of time. However, it is important to note that excessive revving can cause damage to the engine and is not recommended."
What does the recent move by Yahoo to spin off Alibaba shares actually mean?	"OK.  My understanding is that they are not doing with the intent of savings on taxes.  The intent of the spin off is not tax related.  However, tax consequences could prevent the deal from happening.  If they can structure the deal to save yahoo a bundle on taxes then the spin off makes good seance.  Yahoo is worth about 45 billion.  They own 15% of Alibaba and that's worth about 40 billion.  So investors are therefore concluding that Yahoo's core businesses is only worth about 5 billion. If they can spin off the Alibaba shares into a new company, it will take that 40 billion with it.  Leaving Yahoo as worth about 5 billion.  The trick here is that most people ""in the know"" figure that Yahoo's businesses is actually worth about 7 or 8 billion. So by doing the spin off they think that the shares of the remaining Yahoo corp will correct to show the 7 or 8 billion valuation.   The spin off only works if it can be done in a tax saving manor.  That's where the tax headlines are coming from.  If they were to pay the standard tax on disposing of all of those Alibaba shares then the deal would no longer make money for the investors."	The recent move by Yahoo to spin off its stake in Alibaba means that it plans to separate its remaining shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant from its core internet business. This would allow Yahoo to maintain its investment in Alibaba as a separate entity and potentially reduce its tax bill. It would also give Yahoo's shareholders direct ownership of the Alibaba shares, enabling them to potentially benefit from the growth of the Chinese market without being tied to Yahoo's declining core business.
What's the difference between and MD and an D.O? What is Osteopathic medicine?	I'm a DO student (and I'll actually ELY5): Present Day: MD's and DO's do all the same things. Any kind of doctor you've heard of--surgeon, pediatrician, etc.--may be an MD or DO.                However, DO's also must learn a little more about muscles and bones, and they can fix certain problems like back and shoulder pain.  We call this Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT). Unfortunately, the guy who invented osteopathy, A.T. Still, also had some very bad ideas. For example, he once claimed that he cured a very bad disease (yellow fever) in a baby by shaking it hard enough. This is not a good idea.   Overall, the vast majority of DO's never use manipulation once they're out of school. Some that do are also overly emphatic about what OMT can do, and sometimes they ignore facts.   In Europe, DO's are not the same as MD's, as DO's there are essentially chiropractors. So practicing in Europe after earning a DO degree in the US can be more difficult.   Overall, if you were in a hospital after, say, a car crash, all the doctors from the Emergency Medicine doctor you see first, to the Orthopedic Surgeon who fixes you, to the Hospitalist who follows you for other medical issues while you're in the hospital, to the Physical Medicine and Rehab physician who helps with rehab, to the Family Doc you see for a follow-up, could all be DO's, and you probably couldn't tell unless you saw their coat.      Hope that helps ;)      EDIT: grammar and formatting	MD stands for Doctor of Medicine, while D.O. stands for Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. While both types of doctors can practice medicine and prescribe medication, the approach to healthcare is slightly different. Osteopathic medicine focuses on treating the whole person, rather than just symptoms or specific illnesses. This can involve using manual manipulation techniques to improve the body's natural function and utilizing a holistic approach to patient care. Both MDs and DOs complete four years of medical school, but DOs also receive training in osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT).
Could we terraform the Moon and colonise it?	Nothing theoretically prevents it, given enough time, money, and technology.  It would just be a lot easier on Mars due to the higher gravity, ~1 day rotational period, and much greater abundance of key materials like water. The low gravity of the Moon means that it would lose any atmosphere artificially created for it, but that would happen over very long timescales by human standards.   The lunar soil is overwhelmingly silicon dioxide (SiO2), so a lot of machines spread over the lunar surface and powered by the Sun could release gas fast enough that it would accumulate more quickly than it dissipates into space.  Carbon is relatively scarce though, and one way to change that is by deliberately impacting a lot of carbonaceous asteroids. Also, it's not sustainable to have an all-oxygen atmosphere because of how reactive oxygen is - you need an inert gas providing most of the pressure.  Argon or nitrogen (or both) would do, but both would have to be imported in massive quantities. The Moon has some water ice, but not enough for an *ecosystem*.  You would have to crash a lot of comets into it to deliver enough water. Even then what you get for a long time would be a violent environment that would be extremely difficult to use until you could stabilize it.  The low gravity means the air column would be taller than on Earth, and the fact that the Moon is tidally locked means its air flow would most resemble Venus or Titan. Still, no law of physics makes it impossible to figure out how to manage such a system and turn it into livable conditions.	While it is technically possible to terraform the Moon by introducing an atmosphere and warming it up to a habitable temperature, the process would be extremely difficult and cost-prohibitive. Additionally, the Moon lacks a strong enough magnetic field to protect a potential atmosphere from the solar wind, and it also lacks many of the resources necessary to sustain life. It's not impossible that humans could eventually colonize the Moon, but it would require significant advances in technology and infrastructure.
If most of America really doesn't like the main options presented for President, what can anybody actually do about it?	Well, we're currently in the process of 50 states and some territories worth of intra-party elections to determine who the nominees are. That kind of sounds like the opportunity to have done something about who gets nominated. If so much of America is unhappy with the parties' nominees, I have trouble blaming anyone other than the 85% of voters who didn't participate.	If someone is not satisfied with the main options presented for President, they can consider taking the following steps: 1. Vote for a third-party candidate who aligns more closely with their beliefs and values. 2. Become informed about local and state elections and vote for candidates who align more closely with their beliefs and values. 3. Get involved in grassroots movements to promote political change and support candidates they believe in. 4. Contact their elected officials and express their concerns and opinions. 5. Educate themselves and others on the importance of participating in the democratic process. It's important to remember that every vote matters and can have an impact on the outcome of an election.
If banks only insure your money for around 100k, how do people like Bill Gates protect their enormous wealth?	As /u/Hajaku points out, most of their wealth is not in the form of bank accounts. There are undoubtedly many, many, many millions of his dollars in bank accounts. The insured portion is *almost* irrelevant as American banks don't typically lose money (especially of their depositors) but even if they did, it wouldn't hurt him too much. People like Bill Gates money invested in all sorts of ventures. People like him often can't even tell how exactly where their money is or what it is even doing. They have a literal team of people that handle it. If he needed, for some reason, a huge sum of cash that wasn't available in his bank accounts, he could liquidate stock and bond purchases for more cash rather quickly.	People like Bill Gates often have a diversified portfolio of assets, including stocks, real estate, art, and other valuable investments. They may also utilize the services of private banking institutions or asset management firms that specialize in managing and protecting large sums of wealth. Additionally, they may purchase insurance policies or invest in other financial products that offer additional layers of protection for their wealth.
Israel, how was it born exactly?	For the longest time, Jews have had a rough time. People all over Europe have had it out for them since the Middle Ages. They've been treated as second-class citizens and have experienced abuses from structures of power, including indiscriminate killing of those following the Jewish faith, most famously under the regime of Adolf Hitler, whose extermination of Jews is commonly referred to as the Holocaust. A big factor in this situation is the lack of a central homeland of the Jewish people. They tried, rather unsuccessfully, to integrate themselves into whatever culture they found themselves in until they were rooted out or hunted down.  This unstable situation gave rise to Zionism, the movement for Jews to establish their own state (country, nation, whatever word you prefer), preferably in Israel, the biblical promised land, also called Palestine. The Zionist movement was kickstarted and championed by a man named Theodor Herzl. He petitioned different world powers for a grant of land for the Zionists to form a state and begin attracting Jews from around the world to make up the population. This was tricky, as the world powers were only willing to give up fairly crappy bits of land (Britain was ready to give the Zionists Uganda), and the Zionists at large were dead set on forming their state in Palestine. A breakthrough came with the Balfour Declaration, a position on behalf of the Crown pledging its support for the Zionists' place in Palestine. The declaration was later adopted by the League of Nations.  Jews began purchasing land in Palestine and working it to sustain themselves and form communities. This pissed off the local Arabs, sparking tensions that are still very present today. Over time, more and more Jews went to Israel. There were challenges along the way, such as immigration restrictions imposed by the British, unrest from the native populations, invasion attempts, the usual birth pangs of any young nation, et cetera.	Israel was created as an independent state on May 14, 1948, following the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of a partition plan to divide British Mandate Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. The plan was accepted by the Jewish leaders and rejected by the Arab leaders, leading to a war between the newly established state of Israel and the surrounding Arab states. Israel emerged victorious and expanded its borders, while many Palestinians were displaced or became refugees. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has continued since then.
Why is brown dominant over blue in eye colour?	Pigments absorb some colors and reflect others.  So the green leaves you see on plants are actually absorbing every color *except* green, and reflecting back light mainly at that wavelength. When you add more pigment of one color, you are absorbing more and more of the light that hits that surface, so the color gets darker and darker, but stays the same hue. When you add more pigments of several colors, the color gets darker over all (you are absorbing more light and reflecting less) and also gets muddier (instead of reflecting only red or only green, you're reflecting smaller amounts of both red and green, which together we perceive as brown). So genes which give people dark pigments, combined with those that give light pigments, may be slightly less dark (if they are producing less pigment overall) but the dominant hue will always be the hue of the darker pigment (because it will be absorbing all of the hue that the light pigment was reflecting).	Brown is dominant over blue in eye color because brown eye color is determined by the presence of melanin, which is a dominant trait. On the other hand, blue eyes are caused by the lack of melanin in the iris, which is a recessive trait. Therefore, if an individual inherits one brown and one blue allele, they will have brown eyes because the brown allele is dominant over the blue allele.
