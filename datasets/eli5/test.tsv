Why hot water bottles are so good for fixing Period Cramps?	It used to be an old wives tale that heat would soothe internal pain from cramps, childbirth, and gastrointestinal issues. Scientists actually studied why this is, and came up with this reason: it's not just a comfort thing. Heat, specifically about 104* Fahrenheit, actually switches certain pain receptors off at a molecular level, specifically pain receptors in the viscera, or gut/abdomen. Different parts of the body have different types of pain receptors. Heat happens to turn off some of those pain receptors.  Currently, scientists are expanding upon this reason to create new, and less damaging, forms of pain relief.	Hot water bottles are good for fixing period cramps because the heat can help relax the muscles in the uterus and decrease the intensity of the cramps. The warmth also increases blood flow to the area, which can help alleviate discomfort. Additionally, hot water bottles provide a comforting sensation and can help with overall relaxation and pain relief.
What happens to juvenile offenders that turn 18 while they are incarcerated in a juvenile detention center?	"It's not black and white - juvenile laws vary greatly from state to state. Former data analyst for the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice here. In Georgia, you could be sentenced as an adult and then spend all of the time up to your 17th birthday in a YDC (Youth Development Campus, i.e., youth prison) before being transferred to adult prison with the GDC. If sentenced as a juvenile you could spend a maximum of 5 years in a YDC under a Designated Felony commitment. There are ""kids"" in the Eastman YDC who are 20 years old."	When a juvenile offender turns 18 while they are in a juvenile detention center, they may be transferred to an adult correctional facility to complete their sentence. The specifics of the transfer depend on the laws and policies of the particular jurisdiction, but in general, the transfer is made to ensure that the offender is housed in a facility that is appropriate for their age and level of risk. In some cases, the juvenile offender may also have the opportunity to apply for parole or other early release programs while they are still in the juvenile detention center.
Why does changing screen resolution (more specifically, a custom resolution) will harm your computer?	The key statement is “Intel has not tested, and does not warranty” the custom resolution. In practice, it’s highly unexpected for there to be long term damage to the computer, but unexpected things happen all the time in computing. Intel doesn’t want to take responsibility for a setting they don’t list on the hardware specs and which they haven’t proven to work in their labs.  So what could theoretically happen? Among other things, * Unexpected voltage or temperature concerns causing shutdown or heat damage * Corner case hardware bugs that could cause graphics card or driver crashes or performance loss * Corner case software bugs which could result in driver or system crashes (“the device has stopped working” messages or blue screen of death) The above are a few things which Intel would have thoroughly tested for on standard resolutions before releasing the chip. But a custom resolution can’t be anticipated, so they have to add a legal notice that the user takes responsibility for what could happen next.	Changing the screen resolution, including a custom resolution, will not harm your computer. It may result in display issues or reduced image quality if the resolution is not compatible with your monitor's capabilities. However, this can be resolved by simply reverting to the previous resolution or finding a suitable one.
what is that horrible tingling feeling you get in your chest and stomach when receiving bad news? or when something really hurts your feelings?	That is anxiety. Your body responds with heightened sympathetic nervous system arousal. It can cause a surge of adrenaline. This arousal is also caused by a sudden change in neurotransmitters like serotonin, GABA, and corticosteroids. So to put it in ELI5 terms think about fight or flight. It is your physiological reaction to hearing those bad news. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that tell the brain what to do and feel. Hormones are chemicals that tell the body and its organs what to do and feel. Something unpleasant alters those chemicals (neurotransmitters and hormones) causing your body to react . The uncomfortable, sick, anxious feeling you get are the body's response to those chemicals.	"That feeling is commonly known as ""heartache"" or ""emotional pain"". It is caused by the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline in response to the distressing news or situation. These hormones can cause physical sensations such as tightness in the chest and stomach, increased heart rate, and difficulty breathing. It is a normal response to difficult or upsetting experiences."
Why don't markets sell live fish? ie catfish, lobster	Fishmonger here. As many have stated, lobsters are usually sold live. They're pretty hardy creatures, but the tank itself was expensive requires a lot of maintenance. I've seen live fish at specialty stores, mostly larger ones in Chinatown. But, for regular people in the suburbs, there's not much of a market for live fish. Even whole fish, not a lot of people like to buy because of how much work is involved. Also, people don't really like the idea of having to kill their own food.	Some markets do sell live fish, such as certain fish markets and Asian markets. However, it may not be as common in mainstream supermarkets because of the cost and logistics involved in keeping the fish alive and fresh. It can also be more difficult to handle live fish and meet health and safety regulations. Additionally, some customers may not feel comfortable purchasing live seafood and prefer to buy pre-packaged or pre-cooked options.
"Why it seems that most animals have circular irises, but cats and goats have ""slits""?"	Since cats are particularly well evolved nocturnal hunters. Their eyes have adapted to see in very dim lighting conditions. This means that their retina (the light detecting part at the back of the eye) is more sensitive.    The reason they have narrow pupils is to allow them to limit the amount of light falling on the retina when it's bright, so as not to damage it, but still allow them to form a good image.   When they hunt at night the pupils open up wide to allow more light onto the sensitive retina so they can see really well.	The shape and size of the iris in different animals are related to their visual needs and behaviors. Animals with circular irises, such as humans, primates, dogs, and horses, typically have good depth perception and a wider visual field. However, animals that are active hunters, like cats, and prey animals, like goats, need to focus and track their prey in different lighting conditions. The vertical pupil of cats allows them to judge distance better in low light, while the horizontal pupil in goats gives them a wide panoramic view of the environment and enables them to detect predators approaching from the side. So, the shape of the pupil in animals is an evolutionary adaptation that helps them to survive in their respective environments.
If you are still conscious for several seconds after being decapitated, what would be happening physiologically? Would you instinctively breathe even though you wouldn't need to?	I was super interested in this a while back and did some research. Obviously we can't study this kind of thing humanely, but there is anecdotal evidence of some consciousness (pretty much always the head the head just sort of looks around in shock/fear) from the guillotine and one story I remember reading about an Iraq (Afghanistan?) veteran talking about a friend whose head was removed during an attack. The most interesting example was some guy (don't remember who it was, hopefully some other commenter will help me out here) who knew he was going to be executed and told the executioner he would try to say something when his head was off. He didn't, but the executioner called his name several times and the head did look at the man each time. Also, if I remember correctly, it takes 4-7 seconds to go unconscious  due to cutting off the blood supply if you are hanged without breaking your neck (also unsure about this statistic, sorry for all these parentheses but like I said I was interested in this a while ago and have forgotten a lot). I believe that 4 seconds also comes up in rats who are decapitated. I made that (very unscientific) connection on my own, but it seems logical that your brain needs a few seconds without blood supply before it entirely powers down and 4 seconds is the number that seems to come up the most. If you think about it, it doesn't really make sense that you would die literally INSTANTLY, since nothing has actually happened to your brain and it is likely going to die due to blood loss. Anyway, the little evidence I found seems to point to the fact that the brain is still working, but you're probably in too deep a state of shock and the time frame too small for you to actually do or think of anything (other than maybe pure shock/fear) as demonstrated by the fact that shocked or painful looks are the only things that come up in even the most fantastic of stories and by the one guy who actually did try and fail to do something more. As far as things like heartbeat and breathing, those are involuntary and still happen in a state of shock, so I imagine your brain is still sending those signals to the neck, though obviously no one is listening.	It's unclear whether someone would be conscious for several seconds after being decapitated as this is a highly debated topic among medical experts and there are no conclusive studies on the matter. However, if this were to occur, it's possible that the body might still have some residual energy or oxygen in the system that could enable some reflexive actions, such as gasping for air instinctively. But again, it's important to note that decapitation is a very traumatic and deadly event, and any discussion on this topic should be done with sensitivity and respect.
Will placing a glass jar upside down in the fridge prevent it from becoming moldy? If so, why?	No it won't stop it from going mouldy. It might slow that down depending on how crap the lid is. The bacteria/moulds don't care which way up they are. Mould normally grows on the top because these things are aerobic (they need oxygen to grow) and that's where the product meets the air. Some things are packed at low pressure so there isn't much air in the top of the jar (hence that popping button thing on top) or are pasteurised with the lid partly open then sealed so the air inside contracts as it cools. This is usually in an area that's more free of bugs than your kitchen is.   When the bugs inside are exposed to air again, they can start to grow. The low temperature in the fridge slows them down a bit.   When you put the jar back in your fridge, the seal is probably not perfect so some more air can get in. If you turn the jar upside down, the product helps maintain a seal so it's less likely that air will get in.	Placing a glass jar upside down in the fridge may prevent it from becoming moldy because it helps to create a tight seal and prevent air and moisture from getting inside. Mold thrives in moist environments, so keeping the jar dry is essential in reducing the risk of mold growth. However, it's essential to note that if the food inside the jar is already contaminated with mold spores, simply flipping the jar over will not prevent mold growth.

What factors could lead a property to be sold under market value?	The two biggest ones are: A) The seller has some sort of personal issues.  Maybe there's financial distress  &  they urgently need money for something else.  Maybe they need to move across the country on short notice.  Maybe the owner died/divorced  &  their estate just wants to get the property liquidated ASAP so the funds can be redistributed. B) There's something wrong with the property that's not immediately obvious that *actually* lowers its value below *apparent* equivalent properties.  It might be a structural problem that requires expensive repairs, environmental issues that will be costly to clean up, future zoning/construction changes.	There could be several factors that could lead a property to be sold under market value, such as: 1. The property may be in a distressed condition, such as having structural issues or requiring extensive repairs. 2. The seller may be in a hurry to sell due to financial or other personal reasons. 3. The property may have been on the market for a long time, which could result in the seller lowering the price to attract buyers. 4. The location of the property may be less desirable, such as being situated next to a busy road or near a noisy factory. 5. The seller may be motivated by a quick sale, and not necessarily the highest price, for example, due to a change of location or job.
Why are there two letters in English, C and K, that make exactly the same sound?	The Romans, originally, used C to represent the /k/ sound, but several hundred years later, their pronunciation shifted. After the shift, words that had a /k/ followed by either an I or an E, were pronounced with an /s/, instead. (In some times and places, it may have been a /ch/, instead.) But in writing, they kept the old spelling, and it wasn't a problem: everybody just learned that the letter C sounds like /s/ if it follows an I or an E, and like /k/ otherwise, and there simply *were* no Latin words with a /k/ sound followed by an I or an E. But eventually, people in western Europe started wanting to write down languages other than Latin, some of which *did* have /k/'s followed by I's and E's, so they reintroduced the letter K (from the Greek alphabet) to serve in cases where a C would be read as having an /s/ sound.	"The reason for having two letters that make the same sound in English language is due to the historical development of the language. English has borrowed words from several different languages over many centuries, resulting in multiple ways of spelling the same sound. For instance, words derived from Greek or Latin often use the ""c"" spelling, while words from Germanic or other sources may use ""k."" Despite the spelling differences, both letters are used interchangeably to represent the same phonetic sound."
Why the illuminati and 2012 new world order conspiracies are so popular	"People are pattern seeking in nature. When someone stumbles upon a pattern, they can start to connect the dots. However, we all have biases, and many people connect the dots in a biased way (usually in regards to some fantasy they would like to see acted out). Now, let's just say you are an auto mechanic. You watch the news, you see things getting ""worse"" in the world. You don't like the president, you don't like the pope, you feel stuck in a rut. You don't have a cool car like the guy down the street, or a big house like your older brother. You kind of wish something exciting would happen, or the world would flip around a little bit so you can see something entertaining that takes you away from the mundane.  Many people want to latch on to these theories because they see the dots connected by some biased person that leads them down a path to a conclusion. This conclusion would seem nonsensical to the average person, but delve into a blog, or a book with all these patterns shown, and you somehow feel enlightened. You feel like the more you know, the safer you will be when the day comes that the NWO takes over. It's just a doomsday fantasy. It's something that will draw you out of your boring life.  To not be biased, there is also the possibility that these conspiracies are true. Just stay informed, and don't trust information you see that is not scientific or does not have a credible source. There are also documentaries debunking most of the conspiracies out there. I just watch plenty of the Discovery Channel and National Geographic, and you see these programs on all the time."	These conspiracies are popular because they tap into people's fears and anxieties about the unknown and the future. The idea of a secretive organization controlling the world and predicting catastrophic events is both intriguing and terrifying to many people. Additionally, the internet and social media have made it easier for these conspiracies to spread and gain traction, as they can be easily shared and discussed among like-minded individuals. However, it is important to note that these conspiracies have been widely debunked and lack credible evidence.
Why doesn't the winter solstice sync with the new year?	It's because Easter is tied to the spring equinox.  The calender was made to match certain dates up to make Easter fall on the spring equinox.  Its sort of a weird blend of pagan holidays and christian ones It's important to note that the winter solstice isn't the shortest day in the southern half of the world.  The southern hemisphere has their longest day on that day.  So the Gregorian calander has been decided to be sort of a unifying calander	The winter solstice occurs on December 21st or 22nd each year, while the start of the new year varies depending on the cultural or religious tradition. This is because the concept of a calendar, which determines the start and end of a year, has been developed by various societies based on their own beliefs and needs. For example, the Gregorian calendar, which is commonly used in much of the world, was introduced in 1582 and designed largely for religious purposes by aligning with the cycles of the Sun and the Moon. While the winter solstice is an astronomical event based on Earth's tilt and orbit, the start of the new year represents cultural, historical, and religious traditions, and varies across different societies and cultures.
How does helium make my voice change to a higher pitch?	"Its lighter than air, so when you speak it moves faster than air you speak with normally would and this results in a higher frequency . And its not terribly dangerous but keep in mind every breath of helium is a breath your body gets no oxegyn from so don't do to many or you may pass out (long before you get to passing out your chest will feel.on fire and tight youll get dizzy and lightheaded as your body tells you ""hey dumbass take a real breath""). Even if you ignore all of your body's ""you're killing"" me signals you will begin to breath normally once you pass out.  Edited to insert a missed """	When you inhale helium, it changes the way sound waves travel through the vocal cords and the vocal tract. Helium is a very light gas that has a lower density than the air we normally breathe. When you speak, your vocal cords vibrate and create sound waves that travel through the vocal tract and out of your mouth. When you breathe in helium, the lower density of the gas reduces the speed of sound waves in your vocal tract, causing your voice to sound higher in pitch. This effect is temporary and will go away once the helium is exhaled from your lungs and the normal air is back in your vocal tract.
How do we know our galaxy is spiral-shaped and not another shape (lenticular, elliptical or irregular)?	The simple evidence comes from looking at the Milky Way (our galaxy) in the sky. We see a flat, thin disk with a bulge in the middle. This rules out elliptical galaxies, which are smoother in shape and irregulars. Spirals and lenticulars look similar edge-on.  Typically, there is a difference between the ratio of the central bulge and the disk radius for spirals and lenticulars, but it doesn't provide definite evidence. Ours is typical for a spiral.  However, we can also look at the motion of stars and interstellar gas clouds to map these as a function of distance from the central bulge. The rotational motion is consistent with what we'd see in a spiral galaxy versus other types.  We can also look at the distribution/type of mass (colour, gas fraction) which again is consistent with a spiral galaxy.  Hence we have several pieces of evidence which all point to a spiral. We have looked at other spiral galaxies, figured out the characteristics that differentiate them, and realised that our galaxy fits best as a spiral.	We know that our galaxy is spiral-shaped due to various observations and measurements conducted over the years. The shape of the Milky Way has been determined by studying the distribution of its stars and gas, as well as the motions of those objects around the galactic center. The shape has also been confirmed through studies of other spiral galaxies in the universe. Furthermore, observations from different telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gaia satellite have been instrumental in determining the shape of our galaxy.
Why aren’t there any diseases which benefit the human body?	"Disease more or less by definition is something problematic.  There are certainly plenty of bacteria that we exist with symbiotically and derive benefit from, like those inside your GI tract.  > Surely a disease that would benefit the human body wouldn’t be cured on purpose? The body doesn't cure things *on purpose.* It attacks things it recognizes as foreign. Including beneficial things like transplanted organs *necessary for survival*. Since the body isn't smart enough to say ""Oh, this might be good, I'll leave it alone"" there isn't a strong selective pressure for a disease to evolve goodies in exchange. edit: me no sentence good."	Diseases are caused by harmful pathogens or mutations in genes that disrupt the normal functioning of the body. These disruptions can lead to complications and health problems that can have negative effects on overall health and well-being. While there are some diseases like sickle cell anemia that confer certain advantages in certain conditions, they are still overall harmful to the body and are not considered beneficial. Additionally, the concept of a disease being beneficial to the human body goes against the basic definition of a disease which is a disorder or abnormality that impairs normal function.
Why are so many early names of many things in Canada and the USA just Algonquin pejorative terms?	"That's exactly it. Why come up with a new name when someone has already created a name. If you are with someone and you see a big hairy thing with giant antlers that you don't recognize and ask ""what is that?"" And they say ""it's a moose"" then why would you argue with them? You don't have a name for it,  and certainly not a more accurate one."	Many early names of places and things in Canada and the USA were derived from Algonquin words because the Algonquin people were one of the largest and most widespread indigenous groups in those regions. European explorers and settlers often interacted with Algonquin people and borrowed words from their language to name places and things they encountered. However, it is controversial to suggest that all, or even most, of these words were pejorative. Many Algonquin words simply describe the features of the landscape or the characteristics of animals and plants in the area.
When you make an entire bucket of water boil, why doesnt the water vaporize at the same time ?	"So for water to turn from liquid to gas it needs to be at a certain temperature (usually 100C) and then it needs to absorb enough energy to transition from liquid to gas, this is called Latent Engergy of Vaporization. This is why water ""boils"", because the pot of water may be at 100C but as some of the water absorbs enough energy to turn to gas it bubbles up through the rest of the water. The amount of energy for water at 100C to turn from liquid to gas is about 100 time more energy than to heat the water from room temperature to 100C. This is why only small parts of the water turn into gas at a time. You can ""flash boil"" water, where it would all vaporize at once. To do this you would have to heat the water under enough pressure to raise the boiling point high enough that you could get enough energy into the water that once the pressure is released and the boiling point drops it all instantly boils. Though this would be extremely dangerous, because that would essentially be a bomb. A better example is ""flash freezing"". Where water is super-cooled then with a single tap it all turns to ice in a second. Look up videos of that."	When you heat water in a bucket, the heat energy is not evenly distributed throughout the water. The water at the bottom of the bucket is hotter than the water at the top. The hotter water at the bottom starts boiling first and releases water vapor. As the vapor rises, it cools off and condenses back into liquid form, forming a cycle of vaporization and condensation. This cycle continues until all the water in the bucket reaches the boiling point and turns into water vapor. Therefore, it is a gradual process and takes some time for all the water to vaporize.
How is the milk of a cow, goat, etc suitable for human consumption?	Humans are mammals which can eat almost anything, the milk of other mammals is similar to the mothers milk (different composition, fat content etc.) so we can consume it, one problem is when you don't have the enzyme for the lactose (sugar in the milk) , this leads to bloating and diarrhea if there is to much lactose in your intestines.	Milk from cows, goats, and other mammals is suitable for human consumption because it is a rich source of essential nutrients such as calcium, protein, and vitamins. These nutrients are important for maintaining a healthy body and supporting growth and development. Additionally, milk contains lactose, a type of sugar that provides energy. The milk is pasteurized, or heated to high temperatures, to kill harmful bacteria that may be present and make it safe for human consumption.
How do they calculate how much calories you've burned after an exercise?	A calorie is a unit of energy, and it takes energy to exercise. Calories burned on a treadmill or FitBit is usually calculated based off of heart rate and BMI.  MEN: Calories Burned = [(Age x 0.2017) — (Weight x 0.09036) + (Heart Rate x 0.6309) — 55.0969] x Time / 4.184 WOMEN: Calories Burned = [(Age x 0.074) — (Weight x 0.05741) + (Heart Rate x 0.4472) — 20.4022] x Time / 4.184	The number of calories burned during exercise is calculated by various factors such as body weight, the intensity of the exercise, the duration of the activity, and the person's metabolic rate. Some popular fitness trackers and machines use algorithms and formulas based on these factors to estimate the number of calories burned. However, these numbers are only estimates and can vary depending on individual factors such as muscle mass, fitness level, and metabolic rate.
How can a side affects of antidepressants be thoughts of suicide?	"The side effect isn't as direct as your post title makes it seem. Rather it goes like this: A heavily depressed person has suicidal thoughts/tendencies, however the depression is so deep that it negates the will/drive to do anything, including committing suicide. On starting the therapy, the therapist realizes that any treatment will fail due to the absolute lack of drive and deep seated melancholia. He prescribes antidepressants. They work as intended and increase the depressive persons activity level, thus making them theoretically ""fit"" for treatment. However in doing so, the pharmaceuticals also increased the likelihood of suicide as the treated person now has enough drive/motivation to act, including potentially acting on their suicidal tendencies. TL:DR Sometimes the only thing keeping a depressed person from committing suicide, is their total lack of drive to act. Antidepressants may work just well enough to up the drive but not well enough to remove the suicidal tendencies."	It is important to understand that while antidepressants can be very effective at treating depression, they do carry a risk of side effects, including an increase in suicidal thoughts or tendencies. This can be particularly true during the first few weeks of treatment, as the medication begins to take effect. It is important for individuals taking antidepressants to be closely monitored by their prescribing healthcare provider to help detect and manage any potential side effects.
What process(es) is/are my body going through once an antibiotic is introduced to my system?	Every drug works slightly different, but in general, the antibiotics will target the bacteria directly. They'll either kill as much of them as they can or stop them from reproducing so that your immune system can finish the job either way. Doxycycline, for example, can directly enter any bacteria, and bind an important molecule that the bacteria needs (that we don't have). This will prevent the bacteria from making any more protein or replicating.  Note that the doxycyclin didn't directly kill the bacteria. However, if you take it through its entire course, then your immune system will catch up and kill it off. Make sure you take the entire course even if you feel better before it's done!	When an antibiotic is introduced to your system, the following processes occur in your body: 1. Absorption: The antibiotic is absorbed into your bloodstream through the stomach or digestive system. 2. Distribution: The antibiotic travels throughout your body and reaches the site of infection. 3. Inhibition: The antibiotic inhibits the growth of bacteria by interfering with their cell walls, protein synthesis or DNA replication. 4. Elimination: The antibiotic is metabolized and eliminated from your body through urine or feces. It should be noted that antibiotics can also affect beneficial bacteria in your gut, potentially leading to side effects such as diarrhea or yeast infections.
What happens in the brain when we see something we dislike on the internet (spiders for example) then feel as if one is touching us?	"The brain is the most powerful organ in the body. It can create sense when there is no stimulation. As such, you can get goose bumps or the ""heebygeebies"". Your brain takes stimulation from another part of your body and creates a sense in another part. For example, you may see or hear a bug and all of a sudden feel itchy all over, as if the bug is on you. You notice that the bug is not actually on you, but you feel as if it is and you must scratch the area regardless. This is a reaction from the subconscious which is reacting to your brain's visual and audio cues."	When we see something we dislike on the internet, our brain processes the visual information and triggers a feeling of disgust or fear. This activation in the brain can also trigger an emotional response, which can cause a physical reaction such as feeling as if one is being touched by the object of disgust or fear. This is likely due to the brain interpreting the visual information as a threat and preparing the body for action, which can include heightened sensitivity to touch.
Is it possible to store a substance with zero heat gain or loss?	"Absolutely no heat loss, from any of the storage ""systems""? No, because there's always a gradient somewhere. However, if you're talking just about the object, it is possible. If the object is at 20 C, and you place it in a temperature controlled box that is carefully tuned to exactly 20 C, the object will experience no heat transfer, as there is no local gradient for heat to transfer. Of course, the heating/cooling systems for the box will have to generate or remove heat as necessary to keep the box at the exact temperature."	It is theoretically possible to store a substance with zero heat gain or loss, also known as adiabatic storage. This can be achieved by using insulated containers or materials with low thermal conductivity and minimizing contact with external heat sources. However, in practice, it is difficult to achieve perfect insulation and completely eliminate heat transfer, so some degree of heat gain or loss is likely to occur.
How can one gets waterpoisoning by drinking too much water?	When someone drinks large amounts of water in a short period of time, the kidneys cannot flush it out so the blood becomes waterlogged. This causes excess water to enter the cells, causing them to swell/and or burst. Swelling of certain cells (such as brain cells) can be highly dangerous, leading to seizures, respiratory arrest, and death.	Drinking excessive amounts of water quickly can lead to water poisoning, also known as hyponatremia. This is because too much water in the body can dilute the electrolytes in the blood, particularly sodium, which can lead to an imbalance of fluids in the body. Symptoms of water poisoning can include nausea, headache, confusion, seizures, and even coma. It is important to drink water in moderation and to replenish electrolytes during prolonged physical activity or excessive sweating.
How do airlines get away with not refunding you ticket money if you end up not being able to travel (i.e.don't receive goods you pay for)?	Your not paying for goods in this instance, you are paying for service.  Compare it to going to a fast food restaurant. You walk up to the cash register, place your order, pay and they start making you food. They are already spending their money in making that burger for you(making sure the flight arrives where and when they said it would). It doesn't matter whether or not you eat the burger(make or miss your flight), you already payed, and they delivered.	Airlines have a refund policy that is included in the terms and conditions when purchasing a ticket. Generally, if a passenger purchases a non-refundable ticket, they are only eligible for a refund under certain circumstances, such as a flight cancellation by the airline. However, some airlines may offer options for changing the date of travel or applying the ticket value towards a future flight. It's important for passengers to carefully read and understand the refund policy before purchasing a ticket to avoid any surprises.
Why do overweight people often seem to maintain at a certain weight?	The bigger you get the more calories you take to survive.  The fat itself is alive so needs calories to maintain, and just moving around takes more calories cause you are heavier.  So as long as your calorie excess isn't ridiculous at some point you'll reach a size that your caloric intake will match your caloric expenditures.  For example a 220 lbs man needs about 3300 calories a day.  So if you only overeat to 3300 calories you'll maintain.	This could be due to a variety of factors, including a slower metabolism, hormonal imbalances, or a tendency to consume more calories than they burn. Additionally, the body may become accustomed to a certain weight, making it more difficult to lose or gain weight. The reasons can vary from person to person, and it is important to work with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized plan for reaching and maintaining a healthy weight.
Why human cloning is considered unethical?	">  So for me cloning sounds like an amazing opportunity to start from scratch and have a normal life. You do know cloning doesn't work like that, right? Cloning is just a way to make a baby with the same DNA as its ""parent"". This baby is an entirely separate individual, it still needs to grow, and despite having the same DNA it can still have a completely different personality, based on its life experiences."	"Human cloning is considered unethical for several reasons. Firstly, it violates the principle of dignity, respect, and autonomy of individuals as it reduces humans to mere products or commodities. Secondly, due to the high failure rate in cloning experiments, it could be considered unethical to expose potentially viable embryos to a high-risk procedure. Thirdly, cloning technology could be misused for unethical practices, like eugenics, where specific traits are targeted and selected for future generations, leading to a loss of diversity and potential discrimination against certain groups. Additionally, it raises moral and social concerns regarding the status of ""clones"" as regular human beings, their identity, and the potential psychological effects on the individual and society as a whole."
Why is it important to Americans, especially conservatives that a politician is a strong supporter of Israel?	The Jewish vote isn't a huge direct factor - US Jews vote on the same things US Christians do by and large, local issues around schools, roads, taxes etc.  The big factors are:  * securing the weapons exports market, because it provides jobs and contributes to campaigns   * Securing an ally in the middle-east, based on the fact that Israel is a democracy whist its neighbours are not. A belief that democracies have to look out for one another.  * A belief of some Evangelical churches (not all, only some!) that the second coming of Jesus is dependent on the Jewish diaspora being returned to the land of Israel. This is based on a few passages of the book of revelations which most Christians Churches consider to not be a part of the 'true' Bible, but some Churches believe it and they are influential in some areas.   * A belief based on recent history that the Jews have suffered immensely and deserve a break, so there is a reluctance to be critical of Israeli policy.	One reason is that many conservatives in the United States view Israel as a key ally in the Middle East and support its right to defend itself against threats from neighboring countries and militant groups. Additionally, some conservatives may view support for Israel as a way to promote American interests in the region and maintain stability. Furthermore, there is a significant Christian evangelical population in the United States that believes in the religious significance of Israel and its role in biblical prophecy.
"Could an object be ""suspended"" between a set of massive binary objects in space? Yes or no and why?"	Yes, but not stably.  You can make the force of gravity from one object on another as large as you want by bringing it really close, so there is always a point that has the right balance of forces.  (It might be inside one of the objects, though). But gravity gets stronger the closer two masses get.  So what happens if our suspended object is nudged just a little bit closer to one of the masses? The gravity from that mass gets stronger, and the gravity from the other mass gets weaker.  The object will get pulled towards the nearer mass, which will make the gravity from it stronger, which will pull the object closer...etc.  And it takes only a small nudge for this to happen. This is called an *unstable equilibrium*: a small disturbance will knock it out of balance.  Imagine putting a ball on the top of a very steep hill; as long as the ball stays at the very top, it will be in balance, but if it moves slightly, it will start rolling down. The other kind of equilibrium is a *stable equilibrium*: a small disturbance will move it, but it will naturally return to the equilibrium point.  This is like putting a ball at the bottom of a valley; you can kick it up the sides of the valley, but it will come back.  Only by kicking it hard enough to get it out of the valley entirely can you get it to escape the valley.	Yes, an object could be suspended between a set of massive binary objects in space if the gravitational force of the two binary objects is balanced in such a way that the net gravitational force on the object is zero. This point of equilibrium is known as the Lagrange point, and there are five Lagrange points in the gravitational fields of two masses. If an object is placed at or near one of these points, it will remain suspended between the two masses without being pulled towards either one. The exact location of the Lagrange points depends on the masses and distance between the binary system.
Why so many people think communism or socialism is evil?	Blaming Communism/Socialism for atrocities caused by the corrupt leaders who ran the countries that had this model is like blaming Capitalism for the death and war unrestrained corporations in capitalist nations cause in other countries for their own gain. I think both models can work, but both are subject to corruption by their leaders.	There are several reasons why many people view communism or socialism as evil. One reason is that these ideologies have been associated with some of the most oppressive regimes in history, such as the Soviet Union under Stalin or Mao's China. Another reason is that these systems are often seen as anti-individualistic and anti-capitalist, which clashes with the values of societies that value free markets and individual rights. Additionally, there are concerns about how communism or socialism may limit personal freedoms and restrict economic growth. Finally, there may be ideological or political differences that make people opposed to communism or socialism based on their own beliefs and values.
How does a key fob authenticator work?	They're not entirely random numbers.  The way it works, to simplify it a lot, is that each token starts with a unique seed number, and then that number is run though a complicated encryption algorithm which generates the next number, and run through it again which generates the next, and again for the next and so on. This is done every thirty seconds or one minute. The token has an internal timer that increments the number.  Basically what that means is, if the central database knows your token's seed, and it knows the encryption algorithm, and most importantly, it has an accurate time source, it knows what number your token should be displaying right now.  There's no actual link between your token and anything, it's a totally self-contained device.  It's just something you have to physically have in order to have access to your accounts. So it adds an extra layer of security. Someone might have your computer, and have your password, but without the key fob too, they can't get in.  The classic three level security mantra is something you know, something you have, something you are.  Something you know is a password, something you have might be this key-fob authenticator just for an example, and something you are is a bit less common; biometric stuff like iris scans or fingerprint recognition, or voice recognition.  Three is ideal, but two is better than one.	A key fob authenticator works by sending a unique code or signal to a receiver, typically located in a device or system that requires authentication. The receiver then verifies the authenticity of the key fob and grants access or initiates a specific action based on the authorization level associated with the fob. Key fob authenticators often use radio frequency identification (RFID) or near-field communication (NFC) technology to transmit the code or signal. Some key fob authenticators may also require a separate input, such as a PIN code, for additional security.
Why are all bigger holidays at the end of the month? (Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas)	Coincidence? New years is literally the beginning of the month, as is July 4th. Christmas was moved to be closer to the pagan holidays of Yule and Saturnalia, while Halloween basically took over for Samhain (which began at sunset on Oct 31st and ended at sunset on Nov 1st). Canadian Thanksgiving is Oct 12th, right in the middle of the month.  As well, American Thanksgiving can actually be as early as Nov 22nd.	There is no specific reason why bigger holidays like Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas tend to be at the end of the month. It could be due to cultural and historical traditions or practical reasons such as aligning with school schedules or work vacations. Additionally, holidays are often associated with seasons and some may fall toward the end of a month because they mark a significant point in that season.
Why are the San Francisco 49ers named that even though they play 40 miles away?	"Because America is doorfucking shitblasting echomountiney super mega ultra high high calorie deep friend ***BIG***. America is full of like many multiples of England's landmass that's **borderline uninhabited**. There's just buckets of real estate. As such, the definition of ""close"" is ENORMOUSLY stretched compared to you guys in Tea Town. 40 miles is nothing. I spent years commuting 40 miles to work each way, every day, and it wasn't even an exceptionally long commute by US standards."	The team was actually founded in San Francisco in 1946 and played its home games there until 1971 when they moved to Candlestick Park, which is located about 10 miles south of downtown San Francisco. In 2014, the team moved to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, which is approximately 40 miles south of San Francisco. Despite the move, the team has kept its original name as a tribute to its roots and the city where it was founded.
Why are cars built with a speedometer that goes much higher than almost all legal speed limits?	I remember this question was already answered if you search for it.  Long story short it's about engine efficiency.  You wouldn't want to push your engine to the max to reach the speed limit, it would be operating at its limits which isn't efficient.  You would want the engine to be working around 50-60% when cruising at the speed limit which most cars do.  Other factors such as engine gearing have an effect too.  That's basically a a rundown of what was the previous answer was.	Cars are built with speedometers that can go higher than most legal speed limits for a few reasons. One reason is that some highways and roads have high speed limits, and vehicles need to be able to safely reach those speeds. Additionally, speedometers are designed to accurately reflect the speed at which the vehicle is traveling, even at high speeds. Finally, some countries or regions may have higher speed limits or no speed limits on certain roads, so manufacturers design their vehicles to meet the needs of those markets.
How do the major uploaders of film torrents have access to them? Do they physically buy it and then upload? How can they upload so many films in so little time?	Some uploaders have connections or work at CD/DVD/Blu-Ray stores. Those stores get the physical copies of movies many days before release. That's why DVD/BD-Rip torrents come out days or weeks before official release. Some probably buy them, but that's kind of a waste of money since someone else who gets them basically for free will upload it even before the film hits the shelves.	There is no clear answer as to how the major uploaders of film torrents obtain access to the content they upload. It is possible that they obtain them through illegal means such as hacking or purchasing from other illegal sources. It is also possible that they use file-sharing networks to acquire the content from other sources. As for how they can upload so many films in little time, it could be due to automation tools or employing a team of individuals to upload content simultaneously. However, it is important to note that these activities are illegal and can have severe legal consequences.
Politics- House of Cards: Season 2 episode 2. What happened? [spoilers possibly]	The President wants Congress to pass his budget to avoid a government shut down. Frank and Tusk get him to agree to a compromise: The Democrats will vote to raise the retirement for Social Security, thus reducing government spending, and the Republicans will pass the budget. The Republican Senate Majority leader agrees to the compromise with Frank and the Tea Party Senator agrees to support it as well. Frank and the Majority Leader strike an agreement that by passing the retirement age amendment, the Senate will count that as passing the entire budget. All is well. The Tea Party Senator backs out of the deal. The Majority Leader tells Frank that he'll put the amendment to a vote, but he can't support it. So Frank starts whipping votes.  He gets enough Republican Senators to agree to abstain so that the vote will be tied. As Vice-President, he gets to vote on any tied bill. Meanwhile, the Republicans are doing a roll-call very slowly to run out the clock before the Senate ends their session.  Frank goes into the Senate and speeds up the roll call. If there's a quorum present, the bill will be passed. So the Republicans walk out to avoid the vote. A quorum is not present. Frank orders the Sergeant-at-Arms to compel the attendance of absent Senators under threat of arrest. The Majority Leader agrees to let enough Republicans be brought in to vote if he can make a political scene to score points. They vote and pass the amendment that raises the retirement age. The Tea Party Senator thinks he'll just be able to filibuster the main bill but is informed of the secret agreement Frank and the Majority Leader made. The main bill has been passed. Frank wins. Everything in that episode is technically possible but **very** unlikely.	In House of Cards Season 2 episode 2, Frank Underwood continues to consolidate his power as Vice President, while tensions rise between himself and President Walker. Frank also manipulates Congressman Terry Womack to lead an investigation into the Chinese money laundering scheme, in an effort to take down his rival, Raymond Tusk. Meanwhile, Claire Underwood faces backlash from her non-profit organization employees, after her latest project requires them to move to the Middle East.
Cost of living. Will the cost of living ever stop going up? What's to stop a can of coke from eventually costing $1,000?	"That might happen some day, because of inflation. Of course, you'll be paid in millions at that point. If the government feels it's a problem, they can artificially ""deflate"" their currency down to reasonable numbers, like Germany did in the 30s when their economy was recovering from the post-Versailles depression that resulted in runaway inflation (with bread costing millions of reichmarks): you could turn in 10,000 reichmarks and get a new shiny mark."	There is no definitive answer to this question as it is impossible to predict the future of the economy and the cost of goods. However, it is important to note that the cost of living is determined by a number of factors, including inflation, changes in the job market, and supply and demand. While it is true that the cost of living can increase over time, there are also factors that can help to mitigate these increases, such as advances in technology and increased competition among businesses. Ultimately, the cost of living is influenced by many complex and interconnected factors, and it is difficult to make definitive predictions about the future.
Why does quanity affect microwave times? Ex 1 Hot Pocket 2 minutes 15 seconds, 2 Hot Pockets 3 minutes.	"It's not really quantity it's volume. Microwaves work by vibrating the molecules inside your hot pocket. As we know, friction creates heat, so they rub against each other until they're hot. More hot pockets means a larger number of molecules to vibrate, therefore more time is required to ""shake"" them hot."	The quantity of food affects microwave times because a larger quantity of food requires more time to cook or heat through properly compared to a smaller quantity. This is because microwaves heat food by exciting the water molecules inside it, and the more food there is, the more water molecules there are to heat up. Therefore, it takes longer for the microwaves to penetrate to the center of the food and heat it all the way through.
Why do companies have 'values' ?	Corporate values aren't just a marketing ploy for customers. If the values are shared by the staff, it can be a powerful tool in improving employee job satisfaction and retention, which in turn improves the companies performance. Of course that only really works if the company leadership actually believes it's 'Values' and practices what it preaches. Some just pay lip service to the idea, hoping that just claiming to have the values will net the potential benefits. (Spoiler alert: It won't)	Companies have values to define their culture and guide their decision-making processes. Values are the guiding principles and ethical standards that shape the company's behavior and actions. Values help establish the company's identity, attract like-minded employees, and build trust with customers and stakeholders. They serve as a framework for the company's operations and enable them to pursue their goals while maintaining their ethical and social responsibilities. Overall, values are essential for companies to align their beliefs and actions and create a strong, purpose-driven culture.
How do paleontologists, etc. determine that they have found a fossil from a newly discovered species?	After considering the closest examples of fossils already discovered and documented, palaeontologists decide whether something is sufficiently different to label as a new species or not. This can be a large part of their job depending on the sorts of fossils they are looking at, and many palaeontologists have much of their academic papers describing what makes certain species that species, or disagreeing with previous publications about the allocation of species status. Dinosaurs actually only represent a small group of vertebrates, itself a small portion of the fossil record. Most of the fossil record is invertebrates, and there can be many many different species of some invertebrate groups. This is why palaeontologists will focus on vertebrates, or invertebrates, or plant fossils, or microfossils; often they specialise in just certain groups within these categories even.	Paleontologists and scientists use a variety of techniques to determine if a fossil belongs to a newly discovered species. These techniques include analyzing the fossil's anatomy, comparing it to other known species, looking for unique characteristics or features, and using dating techniques such as radiometric dating to determine the age of the fossil. In some cases, molecular analysis may also be used to compare the DNA of the fossil with known species. Once all of this data is analyzed and compared, scientists can determine whether or not a new species has been discovered.
"Are ""Private armies"" a possible thing?"	There are numerous corporations called Private Military Contractors (PMCs) that provide advanced security services. A famous example was Blackwater, now called ACADEMI. Others have been Triple Canopy, Unity Resource Group, and the very famous Executive Outcomes. Generally, you cannot use these companies' services very well in their HQ countries, as Western governments are strong enough to crack down on extra-judicial military forces. However, in less well-run parts of the world, PMCs reign supreme as the ideal way to privately secure your own holdings and expansions. Executive Outcomes was famously contracted in Africa to put down a rebellion, which they did so successfully. In more recent times, Blackwater and smaller PMCs took part in the various Middle Eastern conflicts, contracted by governments to aid their militaries, and by private individuals who wanted the services to protect their territory and expand their fields of operation.  Yes, private armies are a thing, and they have been growing stronger over the past twenty years, however they do not operate in the West besides training and office spaces.	Yes, private armies are a possible thing. Private armies refer to privately-owned military forces that are used for the personal or corporate interests of their owners, rather than for the interests of a nation-state. These can range from armed security companies hired to protect private individuals or organizations, to larger mercenary groups hired to fight in conflicts overseas. However, the use of private armies is often highly controversial and raises concerns about accountability, transparency, and the upholding of human rights and international law.
How do tv shows and movies get such perfectly matching speech and lip movement over multiple takes?	I was an extra a few times.  There are mics close to the actors speaking to pick up their lines.  Everyone in the background is supposed to be totally silent.  They move their mouths but say nothing.  We had to take our shoes off because everyone was walking in a hall and the footsteps were too loud.  that's how you get background movement but only pick up the main actors. There is also something called dubbing.  that's when the actor will watch themselves in a sound studio and rerecord their lines.	This is achieved through a technique called ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) or looping. actors come back after filming and re-record dialogue in a studio while watching the footage. They can then match the lip movements of the characters on screen while ensuring the audio quality is the best it can be.
Why is it that humans walk into a bathroom and the faint smell grosses us out, but my dog with her sensitive nose smells a pile of feces from a half inch away and is fine with it?	Human feces is full of bacteria that present a serious contamination risk.  Our repulsion to the smell is a probably an advantageous trait that motivated more primitive humans to poop away from living areas where the smell and consequently, the bacteria could not bother us.  Dogs do not have face a similar pathogenic threat from their feces.  Also, they can pick up valuable information via the smell of both theirs and other animal's feces.  It would be much less advantageous for dogs to be disgusted by their poop.	"This is because dogs and humans have different levels of sensitivity when it comes to smell. Dogs have a much more sensitive sense of smell than humans do, which is why they are often used in search and rescue operations. Additionally, dogs are not as sensitive to certain smells as humans are, as their brains are wired differently. Lastly, dogs have a different understanding of what is considered ""gross"" than humans do, as they are not socialized to have the same behavioral norms as humans."
what it would be like if I was sucked into a black hole	"A process called ""spaghettification"" (I kid you not) where gravity stretches your body until you're nothing but a long string of atoms.  Needless to say you don't survive this process, although the point where you lose sensory input and/or actually die for real is probably up for debate.  Because of time dilation, you'll probably perceive the entire thing in hyper slow motion. The odd thing is that I vaguely recall reading an article once that suggested this may actually be incorrect, but I can't remember where and thus have no source."	Being sucked into a black hole would likely be an extremely violent and chaotic experience. As you approach the event horizon, the point of no return, the gravitational forces would become incredibly strong, pulling you towards the singularity at the center of the black hole. The immense tidal forces would stretch your body into a long, thin shape, and as you crossed the event horizon, you would experience something known as spaghettification, where tidal forces would increase so much that you would be stretched out into long, thin strands of material. Eventually, you would be crushed down to an infinitely small point known as the singularity, where the laws of physics as we understand them break down. In short, being sucked into a black hole would be a very unpleasant experience.
When animals die in captivity, what do they die of? Why is mortality so high?	There are lots of reasons that an animal might die while in captivity. Could be age related cancers or breakdown of organs, could be depression related (it's been shown wild animals kept in captivity suffer from many of the same symptoms as people with chronic depression), boredom related illness (malaise, fatigue, etc), weakened immune systems and the related issues, or any number of other problems. I don't know if you could say that mortality is high, but on the flip side of the argument is that Zoos, Preserves, and Refuges tend to monitor the animal's diets and overall health in a way that simply isn't possible in the wild. Captive animals are fed extraordinarily well, and they also have medical treatment available when necessary.	Animals in captivity can die from a variety of causes including illness, stress, old age, complications from medical procedures, and poor living conditions. Mortality in captivity can be higher due to factors such as inadequate nutrition, lack of proper medical attention, limited space and exercise, and exposure to disease. Additionally, animals that are taken from the wild may struggle to adjust to captivity, leading to higher mortality rates.
Why are people being arrested at the Democracy Awakening protests?	">  It's my understanding that we have a freedom of assembly and that you can't be arrested for peacefully occupying a public space. That's totally true - but ""peacefully occupying"" means ""following the rules.""  Protesting groups near the Capitol, for example, have to agree not to protest on the actual Capitol steps - that's a rule that the protesters were totally aware of.  And the ones that chose to step past the barricades did so knowing they'd be arrested - for the most part, that seems to be part of their plan to earn some press. Like all rights, the right to freedom of assembly ends when we judge that it could harm others.  It's the classic ""Yelling fire in a crowded theater"" argument - protesting outside of the set boundaries is dangerous for protesters and for government officials, so we limit it."	People are being arrested at the Democracy Awakening protests because they are participating in nonviolent civil disobedience, such as sit-ins and demonstrations, in order to push for reforms to protect voting rights, campaign finance reform, and other democracy-related issues. These protests are seen as a form of peaceful resistance to draw attention to the need for change in the democratic processes and systems. While protests are protected under the First Amendment, civil disobedience can result in arrest as a consequence of breaking the law and refusing to leave when ordered by law enforcement.
What do diplomats do, and what does their issuing country do, when they're declared persona non grata by their host country?	Diplomats are in charge of liaising and working with foreign nations. This includes everything from foreign policy to economic, agricultural and public policy. Basically if there is a department for it in the home country odds are there is someone who needs to think about how foreign nations could be involved. If they are declared person non grata they are asked to leave (usually) and are forced to return to their home country. They are deported, basically.	Diplomats are officials representing their home countries abroad, and they engage in a range of activities, including negotiations, security agreements, and cultural events. When a diplomat is declared persona non grata by their host country, it means that they are deemed unwelcome and must leave the country immediately. The issuing country may have several options available to them, including recalling the diplomat, negotiating for the diplomat's return, or declaring a reciprocal measure by expelling a diplomat from the host country in response. It ultimately depends on the nature of the conflict and relationship between the two countries.
Cults and how people get actually get persuaded to join one. I just don't get it.	"You've been picked on your whole life. Stepped on, overlooked, never listened too. You just want someone to care, you want someone to listen. ""Psst. Hey. Hey you. Tell me what's going on. I've got a bunch of friends over here that would like to listen to you, don't worry, we care."" Think of if you made a best friend, and after you two became close enough that you would be upset if they left, and at that point they start asking you to do sketchy stuff. If you're desperate enough to have that friend, you might just do it."	Cults use a variety of persuasive and manipulative techniques to recruit and retain members. These techniques often include love bombing, isolation from outside influences, use of mind-altering practices such as meditation or chanting, and a charismatic leader who is revered and obeyed without question. Members may also be subjected to physical, emotional, and psychological abuse or coercion. Vulnerable individuals who are searching for purpose, meaning, or connection may be more susceptible to these tactics. It's important to be aware of the warning signs of cults and to approach any group that demands unwavering obedience with caution.
What actually happens when you go through ego death on psychedelics?	The difficulty here is the ineffable nature of the psychedelic experience. As a simplified analogy, imagine going to the doctor and having a pain in a part of your body that you can't name. You have to resort to demonstration and pointing to get the doctor to understand. The psychedelic experience is sort of like that in parts, you feel and experience things that you don't have a word for, and the only way to point it out to someone is for them to also experience it. Ego death is the pinnacle of this scenario, where all that was explainable and definable as 'you', is no more. I've never had ego death, but even in my limited LSD experience I know i've felt things that I couldn't explain here in words. I think that's going to make your ELI5 difficult, or impossible, to answer.	Ego death is a term used to describe a profound experience of losing the sense of self or identity while under the influence of psychedelic drugs. During this experience, the boundaries that separate the self from the world around it dissolve, resulting in a feeling of oneness with everything. It is often described as a spiritual or mystical experience that can bring about feelings of enlightenment, insight, and introspection. This experience can vary greatly depending on the individual, the dosage, and the environment, but it is typically characterized by a profound sense of unity and interconnectedness with the universe.
Why aren’t we accessing Dark Fiber?	"The dark (unused or underused) fibers in question usually run between telecom hubs, such as phone company office locations. The big problem in telecom infrastructure is the ""last mile"" -- connecting thousands of buildings to a local telecom hub is expensive. In fact it can cost more than all the long-distance fibers."	We may not be accessing Dark Fiber for various reasons such as lack of resources, lack of demand, or regulatory or legal restrictions. Dark Fiber may be more expensive to access and maintain compared to traditional broadband options in some cases. Additionally, not all businesses or organizations may require the high bandwidth and flexibility provided by Dark Fiber.
"Why the NFL won't let radio stations and TV channels use the word ""Superbowl""?"	"The NFL owns the term ""Super Bowl"" in regards to the game it self. So to use it in advertising, a person or persons or company would have to pay to say it in their adverts. That is why most TV or Radio stations will say ""The Big Game"" instead. If the NFL catches you they will make you pay. Its the same reason using certain songs in Youtube videos will get the video taken down or banned because they don't have consent from the artist.  hope this helps, cheers"	"The NFL has trademarked the term ""Super Bowl"", and only authorized partners and advertisers are allowed to use it for promotions and commercial purposes. This is to protect the league's intellectual property rights and prevent unauthorized use and exploitation of the Super Bowl brand. The NFL has a comprehensive set of guidelines and restrictions for the use of their trademarks and logos, which include the Super Bowl name, logo, and other related marks."
How does word suggest work on a phone?	"There are two things at work to suggest a word: * Your phone or texting app has a dictionary file built in where it can look up words. When you start typing a letter, it can start looking up all the words that start with that letter and make a suggestion. * Your phone also has all your files and text messages stored. It can look up what words normally followed the word you just typed and guess that you might type that word again this time. For example, if you type ""I love"", it can see that 60% of the time you typed ""you"" next and 40% of the time you typed ""puppies"", so it suggests those two words to you. When you combine those two things, it can make a good guess pretty often."	Word suggest is a feature on your phone's keyboard that suggests words for you to use as you type. It works by analyzing the words you have already typed and predicting the next word you are likely to use. The suggestions are based on your typing history, frequently used words, and more. When you see a suggestion that you want to use, you can simply tap it and it will be inserted into your text.
The US Jury system,and why does the decision have to be unanimous rather than majority?	When a person is accused of a crime they are presumed innocent.  In order to prove guilt, a person must be found guilty BEYOND ANY reasonable doubt.  If a juror has reasonable doubt as to a defendants guilt, they are innocent.  Case closed.  It's better to let a guilty person go free than it is to imprison an innocent civilian.  That innocent civilian is all of us.	The US Jury system is based on the principle of having a group of individuals, usually 12, decide on a verdict in a trial. The decision has to be unanimous rather than a majority because it is believed that having a unanimous decision ensures that all jurors have fully discussed and considered all the evidence and arguments presented in the trial. It reflects the higher standard of justice and ensures that a single dissenting juror cannot unduly influence the outcome of the case. Furthermore, it helps to ensure the fairness and impartiality of the trial by requiring that all jurors agree on the outcome.
If i switch the size of my car tires does that effect my odometer?	"Yes.  The odometer works based on how many tire rotations have occurred. As you correctly infer, if the tires are larger then the car has gone further than the odometer ""thinks"". ~~Remember that the circumference goes up with the square of the radius, so~~ a small increase in diameter can have a fairly significant impact. But *usually* tires won't be a LOT larger than the stock tires, since if they were they'd rub on the wheel well.      EDIT: I'm a moron."	Yes, changing the size of your car tires can affect your odometer. If the replacement tires have a different overall diameter than the original tires, it can cause the odometer to miscalculate the distance traveled. This can also affect your speedometer readings as well. It's important to consult with a professional mechanic or tire specialist when considering changing the size of your car tires.
- Why do some people get an uneasy tingling feeling when they bite metal (like keys etc)?	Basically, when you bite on metal, like an aluminium foil, you set up a battery in your mouth and the electrical current stimulates nerve endings in your tooth.   Here is what happens:   1.Pressure from biting brings two dissimilar metals (aluminum foil, mercury in fillings or gold in crowns i.e. **Electrodes**) in contact in a moist, salty environment (saliva, i.e. **The Electrolyte**)   2.The two metals have an electrochemical potential difference or **voltage** across them   3. Electrons flow from the foil into the tooth (i.e. **electrical current**) the current gets conducted into the tooth's root, usually by the filling or crown   4. The current sets off a nerve impulse in the root's nerve   5. The nerve impulse is sent to the brain   6. The brain interprets the impulse as pain   **If you have no metal dental work in your mouth, you should not feel this effect.**	"The uneasy tingling feeling some people experience when they bite on metal objects like keys, coins or silverware is known as ""metallic taste"" or ""galvanic shock"". This sensation is caused due to a small electrical current that is generated when two dissimilar metals come in contact with each other in the presence of saliva, which acts as an electrolyte. This electrical current stimulates the nerve endings in the mouth, leading to the sensation of tingling or metallic taste. Some people are more sensitive to this phenomenon than others."
Why are the worlds fastest men black-skinned?	Statistically, long distance runners of East African origin, specifically from Kenya's Rift Valley, win the most mdeals. Successful sprinters, on the other hand, often have West African origins. Neither of these groups include a large portion of African ethnic groups. Their being black-skinned is incidental. The reason these two groups enjoy a dominance has not been scientifically identified. However, it is easy to pinpoint environmental factors which *may* have encouraged physiological adaption to types of running. To trace a wounded food source over many miles, and to arrive at the corpse before every other hungry animal in the region, requires stamina running. Similarly, outrunning a predator suited to short, speedy attacks can be done only by running very far away without slowing down. (It's worth noting that few other mammals are adapted for long-distance running. It may play a fundamental role in humanity's success.) More scientifically grounded is the 'nurture' side of the equation. It is scientifically demonstrated that those who believe themselves to be more naturally suited to a task can perform better than those who do not think as much - even if their abilities are roughly the same. So, even if there are not physiological advantages afforded Rift Valley tribesman, the culture and assumptions surrounding them encourages high athletic achievement.	There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that black skin color is directly related to speed. The reason why many of the world's fastest runners are of African descent is likely due to a combination of factors, including genetics, cultural and socioeconomic factors, and access to training facilities and opportunities. It's important to remember that athletic ability is not tied to any specific skin color or ethnic group, and that successful athletes can come from all backgrounds and walks of life.
In quantum physics, why do particles react differently when being observed?	"It's important to remember that what you normally think of as ""observation"" is not the same as how we usually ""observe"" tiny particles like photons. Most people relate ""observation"" to a passive act like watching, whereas in reality in order to observe the location of a photon we physically need to interact with it by bouncing things off of it. Imagine being in a pitch black dark room with an empty tin can on the ground, and your job is to figure out where the can is using a tennis ball. Well, you can just throw the ball around until you hit the can. The problem is that now the can is somewhere else, since you just hit it with a tennis ball. So, all you know now is where the tin can WAS, since it's somewhere else now by the very nature of how we figured out its location."	In quantum physics, observing a particle can change its behavior because the act of observation requires interaction between the particle and the observer's measurement apparatus. This interaction can change the particle's state, leading to different behavior than if it had been unobserved. Additionally, the act of observation can also collapse the particle's wave function, fixing the particle's properties to a specific measurement outcome, which can further alter its behavior. This phenomenon is known as the observer effect or the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.
What exactly is “Die PARTEI” in Germany? What does it do if it has power?	It's a joke party, even though they would officially deny it. Currently they mostly point out the nonsense that other parties do, and there's no telling what they'd do if they suddenly got tons of votes. They probably don't know it themselves. I think a few years back they had this campaign, where they asked for donations of 80€ to support their election, and in return they would give you 100€. They did this to point out that parties receive funding from the state based on how much they earn. So, they might be slightly anarchist in their methods, but not radical or anything like that. Edit: Not donations, that's handled seperately afaik. It was a trade, pay 80€ for 100€.	"Die PARTEI (The Party) is a satirical and sarcastic political party in Germany. They describe themselves as a ""serious party with a humorous appearance."" Die PARTEI was founded in 2004 by the German satirical magazine Titanic, and their main goal is to question and criticize the political system in a humorous way. If Die PARTEI were to gain power, it is unlikely that they would be able to implement their policies in a serious manner. However, they have been able to make an impact on certain issues through their satire and activism. In the 2014 European Parliament Elections, Die PARTEI received 0.6% of the vote and won one seat in the parliament. They have used this platform to highlight absurdities and shortcomings in the political system."
Why do some Windows programs have to be installed, while other can be run without installing?	Some programs require dependencies such as .NET / Java. If the user tries to run a program without first having these dependencies available, it won't work. Given the high number of PC users who don't know how to manually install programs, software distributors try their best to make running their programs as simple as possible. I.e. double-click a single .EXE and you're done, versus step 1. install java, step 2. extract the contents of the .ZIP file, step 3. run the program... Some programs also manipulate the registry and shell UI (in order to add themselves to context menus / interact with the OS in some other way). If you were to simply delete the program's folder without reverting these changes, your OS may become unstable. Installing a program allows you to (in most cases) cleanly uninstall it without causing harm.	Some Windows programs need to be installed in order to properly integrate with the operating system and other software. These programs may also need to add files to system folders, create registry entries, or install device drivers in order to function correctly. Programs that can be run without installation are often portable applications that do not require any special setup or integration with the operating system and can simply be executed from their folder location.
How big a farm do I need to feed me all year round?	You can get 25,000 lbs of potatoes on a single acre of land. A human can survive on about 2-3 lbs per day. So you only need really about 1/25 an acre to sustain life. Humans can fully survive on just potatoes and some supplemental dairy.  Of course... This is just for basic survival. If you want a diverse well balanced diet then you obviously need more.... Especially if you want meat.	The size of the farm needed to feed one person all year round can vary depending on the climate, soil quality, and farming methods used. However, a general estimate is that about 2-5 acres of farmland can provide enough food to sustain one person for a year, assuming efficient use of the land and appropriate crop selection. It is important to note that this calculation can vary depending on factors such as crop selection, growing season, and individual dietary needs.
Which has more grip? A wide tire or a narrow tire?	"Engineering answer: generally a wider tire will have more grip, but tires are notoriously load dependent so you'll have to look at a specific tire's engineering documentation to find the coefficient of friction at a specific load (weight + dynamic load). I believe that information is measured experimentally, rather than predicted mathematically.  That's a crappy way of saying ""there is no easy answer without trying it""."	A wider tire generally has more grip than a narrow tire. This is because a wider tire has a larger contact patch with the ground, which allows it to distribute the weight of the vehicle more evenly and create more friction with the road surface. However, other factors such as tire compound, tread design, and inflation pressure also affect the grip of a tire.
How can people say that Obama has been bad for the economy when the economy is by almost every metric better than it was when Bush left office?	> How can people say that Obama has been bad for the economy Because the people who say that are the same ones who have publicly stated that their entire goal in life is to see that he fails, even if it means driving the country off a cliff to do it. And they can get away with lying about it because they have a propaganda department poorly-disguised as a cable news channel.	There are many factors that contribute to the state of the economy, and opinions on the success of a president's economic policies can vary. While the economy has improved since Obama took office, some people may argue that his policies or actions have not been the sole drivers of that improvement, or that there have been negative consequences to certain policies. Others may believe that the economy could have improved even more under different policies or leadership. It's important to consider multiple perspectives and examine data and evidence from various sources when evaluating the impact of any president's economic policies.
Why can't older GPUs run newer versions of DirectX or OpenGL?	Newer versions of OpenGL and DirectX change how the program talks to the hardware and also adds new functions the hardware must support.  Older hardware can't understand these new formats and lack the hardware functionality programs written for the newer standards expect. In theory you could have the driver cover up these changes by emulating in software all the new functionality that isn't supported in hardware but this is tremendously difficult and extremely slow. e: ELI5 version: Imagine you have a stand mixer.  Any recipe that requires basic mixing is fine. The newer model of the same mixer comes with a dough attachment.  New recipes can opt to use this to make the process easier, but your old mixer doesn't have it and can't use it.  If you want to use that recipe you have to replicate the dough-making process *exactly* using a mixer that was never meant to knead dough.  Even if you could do it all the timing in the recipe is thrown off because it assumed you could knead dough much faster than you actually can on the old mixer.	Older GPUs may not support newer versions of DirectX or OpenGL due to hardware limitations. Newer versions of either API may require certain hardware features or capabilities that older GPUs do not have. Additionally, manufacturers may stop providing driver support for older GPUs, meaning that even if the hardware is technically capable of running newer versions of DirectX or OpenGL, there may not be software support available.
What really happens when country A's leader calls country B's leader, where the language isn't the same?	"They have trusted  > interpreters <  on the phone with them, not ""translators,"" since interpreters deal with the spoken language and translators work with the written language.  For Obama that's an interpreter from the U.S. Department of State. Fun Fact: The actual ""Presidential Hotline"" is not a red phone, or a phone at all, it's a data link that produces text, and hence requires translators, not interpreters. It's also officially called the Direct Communications Link (Liniya Pryamoy Svyazi in Russian). Source: I'm a former Presidential Hotline translator. Edit: Putin does not speak English (well enough to conduct negotiations).  Even if he did, he would never deign to speak to Obama in English because there's still a great deal of nationalistic pride associated with the language, especially for Putin, to say nothing of the complexity and sensitivity of the discussions, which would really require him to be bilingual. Even at G-8 meetings where the leaders share a common language they actually almost never use that common language.  All the interpreters are just out of camera range when all those photos are taken. 2nd Edit: Correction: Yes, Putin ""speaks English"" but not remotely close enough to the level to conduct serious negotiation (I should have said -- ""Putin does not speak English well enough."") He is, of course, a former KGB agent, where English was taught quite extensively, but was so meek and ineffectual in the KGB when he was first starting out that he was referred by other agents as ""the moth."""	In order to communicate effectively, the leaders may use an interpreter or translation service to facilitate the conversation. The interpreter will listen to the speaker in one language and translate their words into the other language in real-time. Alternatively, the countries may choose to use a common language that both leaders are fluent in to avoid any miscommunications or misunderstandings.
how do driverless cars handle intense weather like really heavy rain, snow, or hail? Wouldn't the sensors be impaired?	First of all, today they don't. Google has said publicly that their driverless cars aren't ready to handle that kind of weather yet, and no other car claims to be able to handle it. That's one of many reasons why driverless cars aren't allowed on public roads without a licensed human driver at the wheel ready to take control at any moment. Someday, they'll probably be able to handle it. Remember, our sensors are impaired too! Our sensors are our eyes and our ears, plus our perception of the movement of the car. In heavy weather we can't see as well or hear as well - so we need to drive more slowly to account for the increased difficulty. Someday driverless cars will be able to handle it too. Yes, their sensors will be impaired, but they'll do the best they can because they'll be trained in those conditions and they'll know what speeds are safe. Remember, they don't have to drive perfectly to make sense, they just have to drive better than a human driver. Considering how many accidents humans cause in those conditions, I don't think it will be that hard for machines to do better.	Driverless cars rely heavily on sensors and cameras to navigate the roads and make decisions. In intense weather conditions like heavy rain, snow or hail, the sensors can be impaired, leading to difficulty in sensing the surrounding environment. However, automotive manufacturers and developers are working on incorporating different sensor technologies such as radar and LiDAR that can function even in adverse weather conditions. Additionally, some companies also use real-time data from other vehicles and infrastructure to enhance the car's decision-making ability.
Why aren't animals repulsed by my bad breath?	The idea of your breath as a bad smell isn't built into their brain because they've had no reason to evolve that way. Humans on the other hand have, due to various reasons. Maybe it indicated bad heath or disease, and so we've evolved to naturally react and get away from the source.  Smell is subjective. The dung beetle for instance is attracted to what would be a nasty smell for us. It might find other things repulsive, and yet others completely neutral, depending on what's good or bad for it. I don't particularly like the smell of rubber, but I'm not repulsed by it either. It falls more into the neutral category for me, and I think most people are probably the same. Why? Humans never evolved around rubber. It's a new phenomenon. Roses on the other hand, or rotten fish? Yeah we've been around those for a long time and our brain knows what happens if you interact with one as opposed to the other, and so it has come to react in certain ways when it encounters them. There is otherwise nothing else that would somehow make the smell of rotten fish bad. It's just that the brain is labeling it that way and we believe it and react.	Animals are not as sensitive to human scents as other humans are, and they may not be able to perceive the odor of human bad breath. Additionally, animals such as dogs have a more developed sense of smell and may be able to detect subtle changes in their human's breath, but they may not find it repulsive as they have a different sense of smell and a different set of preferences.
Why do we have the urge to shake our hands (or other body part) after they get injured?	"""You're right in that shaking your hand out after hurting it doesn't actually relieve pain, but the vigorous motion seems to block the most intense stuff from really registering as painful. This is all because of how our nerve signals communicate sensory information to our brain. While understanding and treating pain is a massive part of modern health care and a sub-field with a lot of room to grow, what's needed to answer your question is fairly straight forward. When you slammed your finger in the door, you(most likely) felt the immediate pain of the smash and then a rising, duller pain that comes on after a second or two. This is because pain nerves come in two general types; a thicker neuron with a sheath that transmits intense pain signal quickly from a small radius around the receptors in your skin, and a thinner neuron that more slowly transmits pain signals from a more general region of your body. When pressure is put on the skin, the faster pain signals can be physically blocked from reaching the brain while the slower ones pass through. So how is this all related to shaking? By quickly shaking your fingers around, you are subjecting your fingers to g-forces as they are in a constant state of acceleration and deceleration, which could potentially provide enough pressure to dull some of that initial intense pain."" -/u/Zaburino from the last time it was posted. Cheers!"	"The urge to shake our hands or other body parts after they get injured is known as the ""pain withdrawal reflex"". When we injure ourselves, the nerve fibers in the affected area send a message to the spinal cord, which then sends a signal to the muscles in the area to contract and withdraw from the source of pain. This reflexive movement helps to protect the injured area from further damage and also helps to reduce the sensation of pain. Shaking the affected body part can help to further activate this reflex and provide some relief from the pain."
How do boomerangs return to their thrower?	When you throw a boomerang, the boomerang spins in the opposite direction. This means that while the wing at the top is spinning at the same speed as the wing at the bottom, it is actually moving through the air at a higher rate of speed. When it goes faster more air passes. This makes a constant force moving left or right making it return as it sails.	Boomerangs are specially designed throwing tools that are designed to return to the thrower when thrown correctly. The shape of boomerangs allows them to generate lift and spin as they travel through the air. When thrown at the right angle and with enough force, the boomerang will spin and arc in the air, following a curved path. As it reaches the end of its flight path, it will start to slow down and lose its momentum, causing it to turn around and descend back towards the thrower. The combination of the spinning motion and the air resistance creates a lifting force that helps the boomerang return to the thrower's hand.
what makes a professional a professional.	Technically, a professional is someone who gets paid for what they do. That said, in real life calling yourself a professional implies that you have actual skills and hopefully some sort of consistent and dependable work process that you use. If a photographer was a professional I would think that they would: * show up on time * not accidentally delete all the images * bring enough memory cards * bring enough equipment * have some kind of actual billing and time tracking * be able to explain their billing * produce good photos * set expectations correctly * have an idea of what's happening and be able to run the session * know various techniques so they can get the look they want * know what the client wants/is trying to do and suggest better/other ways of doing it * be prepared * communicate effectively That's a lot more than just being paid to take pictures; that's managing the process so that you can take good pictures as well as taking good pictures.	A professional is typically defined by their level of expertise, training, and experience in a specific field, as well as their adherence to ethical standards and behavior. They are expected to possess specialized knowledge and skills that are required for their profession and to continually keep themselves up-to-date with the latest developments and advancements in their field. Additionally, professionals are usually held to a higher standard of accountability, responsibility, and professionalism in their interactions with clients, colleagues, and the public.
Why do I get sleepy after reading 2 hours or studying but my scumbag brain can play Skyrim all night without getting tired?	dopamine / Adrenaline stuff doesn't sit well with me, it doesn't really play a role in WHY you feel sleepy. 2 Hours of studying requires extensive use of the brain centers which releases a host of different kinds of neurotransmitters that stimulate long term potentiation. Skyrim on the otherhand, does not really utilize the brain at all that much. All you are doing in skyrim is the same old practiced routines over and over again. Probably the first couple times of playing skyrim, you had trouble playing for 5 hours a day, until you practiced it enough to be easy. It's kind of like a baby walking. First couple of times, only 2 minutes a day. Now, you can walk for hours. Same stuff, just practiced until you aren't really thinking anymore.	This is because playing video games can be more stimulating than reading or studying, which can lead to increased alertness and a delay in feeling tired. Additionally, the blue light emitted from electronic screens can affect one's circadian rhythm and contribute to difficulty falling asleep. It's important to be mindful of screen time and prioritize healthy sleep habits.
Now that we've all switched from photographing using film to digital photos, why is the quality of printed photos so much lower?	A lot of shops use very cheap, low-quality processes to churn out lots of prints very quickly. The quality is pretty uniformly awful. Professional print houses can do much better work. It's also possible that the source material isn't actually that good. The resolution of a modern computer display may be considerably lower than that of a photographic print, and the display is backlit to boot, which can change how the image looks.  >  when I send it off to get it printed the print is always really poor quality, blurry, discolored and when I put it in a frame the photo will often stick to the glass. Yeah, that just sounds like a crappy print shop.	The quality of printed photos may appear lower for a few reasons. Firstly, digital cameras capture images in pixels, which may not translate well when printed in larger sizes. Secondly, people often view digital photos on screens with a much higher resolution than standard photo prints, making the prints appear lower in quality. Finally, the quality of the printer and paper used to print the photos may also affect the overall quality of the printed images.
What makes it hard to fight huge forest fires like the ones in Fort McMurray and the ones that occur in Australia?	"Key word is ""huge"" here, but mobility, remoteness and severity also factor in.  Those fires have fronts that are hundreds of kilometers long, way out in the woods where there aren't any fire hydrants and it's hard to get any decent amount of equipment to them.  And that fire is mobile and constantly moves. All it takes to spread is a gust of wind picking up an ember and landing it in some grass that's beyond any barrier you try to put up. When it shoves a bit of glowing ash into a crevice in a bone-dry wooden rooftop, a house is lost.  Those types of fires often advance as fast as a man walks, sometimes even faster. When they arrive at a place like Fort MacMurray, they're covering acres and creating their own wind patterns that amplify their speed and reach. Even with access to local supplies of water, the fire on your doorstep is covering just too much area for anyone to effectively cover and protect every single house. You'd need thousands of firemen and they'd all need water pressure to help. So you have to concentrate on saving what you can, and let the others burn."	There are several factors that make it hard to fight huge forest fires, such as the ones in Fort McMurray or Australia. Some of the factors include: 1. High winds: Strong winds can quickly spread the fire, making it difficult to control and contain. 2. Dry conditions: When the weather is hot and dry, it creates the perfect conditions for a fire to start and spread quickly. 3. Lack of access: In remote areas with thick vegetation, it's often difficult for firefighters to get to the fire, making it hard to fight and control. 4. Terrain: Sometimes the terrain is steep and rugged, making it difficult for firefighters to access the fire and navigate the area. 5. Size: Large fires can be challenging to manage due to their size and the amount of resources needed to combat them. 6. Safety concerns: Fighting fires can be dangerous, so safety concerns for firefighters are always a top priority.
Why mobile video players such as The YouTube app won't continue to play when you leave the app/close your phone?	Youtube want you to be looking so they can make ad revenue. You can't click an ad if your screen is turned off. Other apps use Youtube's API to show their videos and the license agreement states your app has to stop playing the video if the screen goes off too, just like Youtube's own app, for the same reason.	Mobile video players such as the YouTube app may not continue to play when you leave the app or close your phone because they require an active internet connection and the app needs to be opened and running in the foreground to keep streaming the video. Additionally, some mobile devices automatically pause or stop background apps to conserve battery or reduce data usage. However, some apps offer a background playback feature that allows the audio portion of the video to continue playing even when the app is minimized or the screen is locked.
If I transfer money from my bank account to someone else's who is with a different bank, does my bank give money to the other bank?	I don't see any mentions of the Federal Reserve here. The Fed is a bank for banks, they hold $$ for banks, just like banks hold $$ for us. When you write a check to someone who deposits it in an account at a different bank than yours, here's what happens: their bank sends an image of that check to the Fed. The Fed forwards it to your bank, who deduct it from your account balance. Then, your bank tells the Fed it's ok to deduct the amount of your check from their (your bank's) balance at the Fed. The Fed then credits the other person's bank, and the other person's bank credits their account. At no point does actual cash have to move.	When you transfer money from your bank account to someone else's account with a different bank, the process involves sending an electronic message from your bank to the recipient's bank requesting the transfer of funds. Your bank will not physically give money to the recipient's bank, but they will transfer the funds electronically. The recipient's bank will then credit the funds to the recipient's account. The process of transferring funds between banks is facilitated through a network of financial clearinghouses that work together to process these types of transactions.
Why does the U.S. Court hear cases about the NFL such as Deflategate?	"There are two court systems in the US. You have Criminal court, where the government tries people for violating laws, and then doles out punishments if they are convicted. You then have civil court. Civil Court is where the government acts as a mediator for disputes between two private parties(lawsuits). All citizens have a right to petition the court to settle their grievances with other citizens. In this case, Tom Brady felt that the NFL had violated a contract they had negotiated(Collective Bargaining Agreement) by punishing him against the guidelines set forth in that document. The NFL by doing this ""damaged"" him by reducing his salary by 25%(4 game suspension). Therefore he petitioned the court to stop the NFL from suspending him, because it violated the contract they negotiated. In the initial trial the judge sided with Tom Brady. On Appeal the Appeals Court reversed that decision and sided with the NFL saying they followed the policies and procedures of the contract negotiated.  If private citizens were banned from using the courts to settle grievances, because it cost taxpayers money, then all contracts would be meaningless, because you couldn't enforce them if one party violated it. The end result would be complete chaos."	The U.S. Court can hear cases about the NFL, such as Deflategate, because they involve legal principles and issues that fall under federal jurisdiction. The NFL is a national organization that operates under federal antitrust laws, and disputes between the league and its teams, players or other parties can involve federal laws and regulations. Additionally, cases related to the NFL and other professional sports leagues can have significant economic and social implications, which can warrant involvement from the federal courts.
Why do companies donate money to politicians that are almost never going to win?	Most of these politicians already hold Important political positions and/or have influence with other politicians or people who can affect change. That being said, these people donate to them in hopes that, win or lose, said candidate will return the favor in any way that they can. There are also some who donate because the genuinely believe in a candidates ideals or position, regardless of their chances of winning - I would say that is the exception to the rule, however.	Companies may donate money to politicians who have little chance of winning for a variety of reasons. One reason may be to gain influence or access to the politician and their platform. This can provide the company with the opportunity to shape future policies that may affect their business interests. Additionally, companies may donate to multiple candidates in order to hedge their bets and ensure that they have a relationship with whoever ultimately wins the election. Donations to losing candidates can also be seen as an investment in future political campaigns or as a way to maintain a positive relationship with the candidate for future opportunities.
How Stokholm Sydrome can be confused for love and vis-versa	I'm no expert, but I can see how it can happen. Normally I'm a pretty hard guy to befriend.  I hate smalltalk.  My only friends are those who stick it out with me to be with my wife, who LIVES for smalltalk! But this past week I was in the hospital for a week.  I was considered an infection risk so I was relegated to a private room which I couldn't leave.  My only interactions for most of the week we're busy doctors, nurses, and overworked CNAs behind gowns and masks. It only took 2 days before I switched my personality to be more witty and charming so they would stick around a little longer.  I found myself telling stories to them that were completely unsolicited or related to anything we were doing.  At first I thought it was the Dilaudid talking, but then I realized I was just craving human interaction, as I suspect most people do. By mid-week I was going stir-crazy.  I literally cried myself to sleep the first time my release date was moved out 2 more days.  Thursday was dark until the NFL draft started on TV.  Someone else was controlling where I could go, what I could eat, the entertainment I had access to, the very humidity of the air, and my days were filled with hours of isolation. But I still saw a variety of friendly people as they went on and off shift and came in to do various tests.  What if all my interaction was limited to one person (e.g. my captor)?  It wouldn't take long for that person to become your world.  After a time, if they treated you reasonably well, you might even consider yourself to have feelings for them, even to love them.  Even if they tortured you at first, you might be excessively grateful if it stopped. That's why solitary confinement is such an effective punishment in prison.  If all you saw all day was your cot, your toilet, and a tray of food coming through a slot in the door, you'd start gnawing the walls just to feel something before long.  Even the guard who threw you in there would be your best friend if he just sat and talked to you.	Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological condition in which hostages or abuse victims develop a bond or empathy with their kidnappers or abusers. This bond may be confused for love because the victim may feel dependent on the abuser for survival or protection. On the other hand, love may be confused for Stockholm Syndrome when one person in a relationship is in a position of power or control over the other. This can lead the person in the submissive role to feel a sense of dependency and attachment to their partner, even if the relationship is abusive or unhealthy. It's important to differentiate between love and Stockholm Syndrome as they are two very different things. While love is a positive emotion that promotes growth and happiness, Stockholm Syndrome is a negative psychological response to a traumatic situation that can lead to long-term damage if left untreated.
Does Putin want to reassemble the Soviet Union? Also, is he a communist in any way?	"That largely depends on what you mean by ""reassemble the Soviet Union"". It's no secret that Vladimir Putin would like to create a ""Greater Russia"" whereby the country recreates a close political union with other countries that were formerly part of the USSR such as Ukraine and the Baltic states. In fact some commentators have suggested he has ambitions more like those of Imperial Tsarist Russia and would ilke to push Russia's borders even further into Europe. However there's no evidence that he wants to restore the economic system of the USSR. Putin himself gained his enormous wealth by exploiting the opportunities opened up when Russia began transitioning to market capitalism. The enormous oil and gas companies that were previously owned by the Soviet government were sold off and have since created vast profits for anyone -- like Putin -- who owns them."	It is not clear whether Putin wants to reassemble the Soviet Union as he has not made any official statements to this effect. While Putin was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in his early career, he has since distanced himself from communism and adopted a more authoritarian and nationalist approach to governance. Putin's current political ideology is often described as a blend of conservative, patriotic, and populist views.
"Why do we recognize certain sounds (such as a gentle ""hey wake up""), but not others when we sleep, given that they are the same volume?"	I sleep through thunder storms and plenty of other loud noises. My dog's have always been able to wake me with quiet mumbles.  It's all about what we feel is a danger to us or the ones we love.  On the other side of the equation I never sleep better than when I awake just enough to hear the voices of close family or friends in the next room  &  then go back to sleep, feelings perfectly safe and content.	When we sleep, our brain is still processing sounds and other sensory information, but it does so at a different level of consciousness. It is possible that we may recognize certain sounds more easily than others because they are familiar to us or because they have a particular significance. Additionally, the brain may be more likely to filter out certain sounds that it determines aren't important or relevant to our current state of rest. This filtering process is an important part of how sleep helps us recover and feel refreshed upon waking.
why are chemical weapons worse than regular ones? Is gassing a town worse than bombing it, assuming the number of innocent deaths is the same?	Chemical weapons are worse because: 1) They kill slowly.  2) They are not as controllable as they drift in the air and on the water. This means they cause a lot of collateral damage.  3) They often contaminate and kill those attempting to treat the injured, and they often have very few to no actual treatments that work.  4) They contaminate the environment for a long time killing people years after the attack. There are still some battlefields from WWI that are toxic and make people sick or even kill them when they spend time in them.	Chemical weapons are considered worse than regular weapons because they have the potential to cause indiscriminate and long-lasting damage to both humans and the environment. Chemical weapons can cause severe and often irreversible health effects, such as respiratory failure, blindness, and burns, as well as long-term environmental contamination. In terms of whether gassing a town is worse than bombing it, there is no clear answer as both types of attacks have the potential to cause significant harm and loss of innocent lives. It ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and the effectiveness of the defensive measures taken by the town against either type of attack.
How do active 3d glasses blink so fast and what is in the lens that causes the lens to actually blink?	"They're LCD screens, a lot like on calculators or wristwatches. But instead of a lot of little, specially shaped segments, they just have one big segment that flashes on an off. There is a bit of special plastic that only allows light through that is polarized: think if it as having waves going vertically and not horizontally. The liquid crystals change how the light going through them is polarized when they get turned on. They ""turn"" the waves from horizontal to vertical. So if the light is one way it can't get through; the shutter is off. But if the light is turned the other way, it can get through, and you can see through."	Active 3D glasses contain liquid crystal display (LCD) shutters in the lenses, which can rapidly open and close to block one eye at a time. This is synchronized with the on-screen image to create the illusion of a 3D image. The glasses receive a signal from a transmitter, which tells the shutters when to open and close. The shutters can blink at a rate of 120Hz or higher, which is fast enough to create a smooth 3D image.
Why does a product 's manufacturing price decrease with an increase of that product's production?	Think of it this way: you order parts for a product that sells for $10/each, and you make a salary of $70K/yr (basically $35/hr for a 40 hour week). You call the part vendor and order 1000 parts. it takes 5 minutes to make the call. That's $8.57 of your time, split over 1000 parts makes $0.0086 per part. Now, if you had just ordered 5000 parts instead of 1000, your phone call would only be adding $0.0017 per part. Little savings like this add up, especially when you are dealing with large quantities.  Another example: loading a plate of metal onto a waterjet table might take 30 minutes. It'll take the same amount of time to load the plate whether the cut to be performed takes 10 minutes or 3 hours. Whoever is paying for that cut is paying for that 1/2 hour of labor, whether they're cutting one little thing, or 200 little things.	The manufacturing price of a product decreases with an increase in that product's production because of the concept of economies of scale. When a company produces goods in large quantities, it can take advantage of efficiencies and cost savings that are not available when producing on a smaller scale. For example, larger production runs can benefit from lower costs of raw materials and packaging, reduced equipment maintenance and repair costs, and streamlined labor costs. As a result, the overall cost per unit of production decreases, making it less expensive to manufacture each product.
what the significance of Deep Throat was?	"DT was a popular porn movie in the early days of porn.   Around the same time the Republican party arranged the now infamous break-in at the Watergate hotel.   The story ended quickly, but two journalists decided to pursue it. At this point they were then helped by a guy inside the government who gave them pointers in the right direction until finally the government was toppled.   When they referred to this mole, they called him Deep Throat. So if people talk about Deep Throat, they often refer to some well placed mole within the system.   If you want the full details, read the book ""All The Presidents Men""."	Deep Throat was the pseudonym given to a secret informant who provided valuable information to reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein during their investigation of the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. The information provided by Deep Throat helped to uncover the role of President Nixon's administration in the cover-up of the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex. The identity of Deep Throat remained a mystery for over 30 years, until it was revealed in 2005 that the informant was former FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. The significance of Deep Throat was that his insider knowledge and tips helped to expose the corruption within the highest levels of the US government, leading to the resignation of President Nixon and ultimately strengthening the principles of democracy and the freedom of the press.
Why are restaurants in an airport allowed to serve food with silverware? Why not plasticware only?	"I wish the person who is stupid enough to bring one of those silverware utensils ""good luck"". With Air Marshals protecting most or even all planes after 9/11, I wouldn't think they be bold enough. Especially now pilots are being trained to protect the cabin though use of deadly force if they were to gain entry into the cabin."	Restaurants in an airport are generally allowed to serve food with silverware because airports are subject to the same food safety regulations as other food establishments, and using silverware is considered a safe and sanitary option if properly sanitized, just as plasticware can be if properly handled. Additionally, airport restaurants often aim to provide a higher quality dining experience to travelers, which may include the use of silverware. However, some airport restaurants may offer plasticware as an option for those who prefer it or for certain types of meals that may be more easily eaten with plastic utensils.
What exactly is the internet? Does it transmit data by wires? Satellites? Radio frequencies? Are there different infrastructure standards for infrastructure in different regions?	The internet is a network of networks.  You pay an Internet Service Provider (ISP for short) for a cable running to your house. This cable connects to a central point where more cables connect (usually quite close to you), which connects it to a bigger cable. This bigger cable in turn goes to your ISP. There are more mini networks like this going to that same ISP. This means that you are now connected to every other computer within the network of your ISP. There is always a path you can take to connect to another computer within this network. In order to connect with other computers in networks maintained by other ISPs, your ISP, and another ISP have agreed to connect their networks to each other. This means that you can now also connect to computers on the network of that other ISP. If there is an ISP that has no direct connection to your ISP, but does have a connection to another ISP which your ISP does have a connection with, then you are transitively also connected to that not-directly connected ISP. The connections within and between these networks can be achieved by any way you can transmit data. Each medium has its own weaknesses and strengths. Usually these connections are a form of cable (since that is the most reliable medium), but they can also be transmitted over radio frequencies, or even via satellites. For connections between continents, there are massive underseas cables. This means that the European network is connected to the American network (for example). Not every computer neccesarily speaks the same language though. So in order for every computer to connect to the internet, some standards had to be defined. There are standards that dictate how computers should request connections to other computers, standards that dictate how data should be transfered, etc. The internet as you know it today is a product of decades of expansion and improvements. Noone really owns the internet, but ISPs and governments technically own parts of the infrastructure that makes up the internet. However, since the internet is so massively complex and interconnected, if any of these parts fail, or get shut down for any reason, it wouldnt affect the internet at large. I mentioned before how the internet always end in a regular computer. That is not neccesarily true. You can replace this computer with any internet capable device, for any number of reasons.  An example you can replace a computer on this network with is a router. The purpose of a router is to create a small sub-network (usually within the house) in order to be able to connect multiple computers at the same time, to the cable provided by the ISP. A computer on the internet can also function as a server. This means that it's sole purpose is to provide data to other computers on the network, when requested. This is how sites like Reddit operate. Your computer sends a request to the servers of Reddit, and their servers in turn return the content of the site to your computer	The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using a standardized set of protocols. Data is transmitted through a complex web of wired and wireless infrastructure that includes fiber optic cables, satellites, radio frequencies, and other technologies. The specific infrastructure standards used to build and maintain the internet can vary by region, as different countries and regions may have different regulatory requirements, technical capabilities, and access to resources. However, there are a number of global standards and protocols that help ensure that data can flow seamlessly across different parts of the internet, regardless of the specific infrastructure being used.
Why do cats and dogs generally show natural aggression towards eachother?	"Usually, if a dog does not like cats, they don't like any other animal at all, except other dogs.(and visa versa) You've got to remember, these animals ARE animals.  They evolved being either the predator or the prey. You just hear a lot about cats and dogs because they are the primary pet sort of animals.  You won't find many animals in the wild that just ""get along"". In a sense, those highly domesticated animals that do ""get along"" are that way because we've bred them to be retarded, more or less.  They'd no longer function as they were in the wild.  It is not just that they *learned* to be dependent, but that their strain would die out on their own even if you could get, say, a pack of wolves to take in your newborn beagle or chihuahua."	Cats and dogs are different species with different temperaments and communication styles. As such, they can perceive each other as potential threats and react with aggression as a means of self-defense. Additionally, in the wild, dogs are natural predators and cats are prey animals, which may contribute to their innate instinct to be wary of each other. However, with proper socialization and gradual introduction, cats and dogs can learn to peacefully coexist.
In TV/movies we always see stand-offs between guys with guns. In reality shouldn't you just shoot as soon as possible?	If both of you have the trigger, there is an equal chance either person might squeeze off a shot. Furthermore, if you don't get a killing shot (and sometimes even if you do), the opponent might still be able to pull the trigger enough to get a shot off. On the other hand, since both parties have equal opportunity at death, there is a possibility for a mutual stand-down, assuming neither side wants to die and/or values life more than getting shot. More importantly, its TV, so a long drawn out standoff is good for ratings.	In reality, the best course of action would depend on the specific circumstances of the situation. In some cases, it may be necessary to shoot as soon as possible to defend oneself or others. In other cases, attempting to de-escalate the situation and negotiating a peaceful resolution may be a better option. Additionally, firing a gun can have serious legal and emotional consequences, so it's important to consider all options and try to make the safest and most effective decision possible.
Why do math textbooks have answers in the back of the book but other textbooks, such as science or history, don't?	Because in math, the solution isn't always what's important. Being able to show your work and derive how you got to the final answer is what true understanding of the material is all about. I've had professors who would give me 0 credit on a question if I gave the right answer but didn't show my work.	Mathematics is a subject which often involves finding a specific solution or answer, whereas science or history may involve subjective interpretations or analysis. Therefore, it may be helpful for students to have a way of checking their math answers. Additionally, math often builds on previously learned concepts, so having access to correct answers can assist students in ensuring they understand the material before moving on to more advanced topics.
How do we make an estimate like there are between 100 and 400 billion stars in the Milky Way?	I'm not an astronomer, nor do I study much about space, but I assume this estimate is based off of what scientists have observed. Example, X volume of space tends to hold between Y and Z stars. Therefore, 1000X will hold somewhere between 1000Y and 1000Z. I'm sure there's other factors that scientists account for when making these calculations.	The estimate of between 100 and 400 billion stars in the Milky Way is typically based on observations and mathematical modeling. One method is to use the observed brightness and distance measurements of a sample of stars to calculate the total number of stars in the galaxy. Another method is to measure the mass of the galaxy and use a density model to estimate the number of stars based on the typical mass of a star. These estimates are refined over time as more observations and data become available.
What exactly is a warrant, what does it do, and why is it difficult to obtain?	"A warrant is authorization from the courts for the police to take some action. That can range from entering and searching your property to arresting you.   Warrants are not *always* required for the police to do these things, but they are *often* required. If a police officer doesn't have a warrant when they need one, you can legally tell them to go away/leave you alone. If they do have a warrant, than they can arrest/detain you for refusing to let them enforce it. EDIT: and the reason it's ""hard"" is because in order to get one, you need to have a sign off from some neutral official  who knows the relevant law. These days that's almost always a judge.  Even though this can sometimes be relatively straightforward, or even trivial, thing to do, it does take at least some time and runs the risk that the judge will disagree on whether a warrant is appropriate."	A warrant is a legal document issued by a judge or magistrate that authorizes law enforcement officials to conduct a search, make an arrest, or carry out some other lawful action. It is difficult to obtain a warrant because it requires the requesting officer to provide probable cause, which is a legal standard that requires the officer to present enough evidence to create a reasonable belief that a crime has been committed and that the requested action will uncover evidence of that crime. Additionally, warrants are granted with a high level of scrutiny in order to protect individuals' constitutional rights and prevent government overreach.
How does turning an old black  &  white picture into color actually work?	Colorizing any black and white photo is very easy, you can even do it with drawings. The shading and detail is already there. Typically you can use a program like Photoshop and select out areas you wish to be a certain color, and adjust the RGB for that spot which changes the color without losing any detail. You can do other things too like adjust lightness and gradients and so on but the simplest method is just using a freeform selection tool (or point-to-point) and colorizing it one section at a time. Like you will select someone's hair and color it, then their skin, then their shirt, and so on and so forth.  There are other methods as well but this is the most common modern method to doing it.	Turning an old black and white picture into color typically involves using image editing software, such as Photoshop or GIMP. This process involves a few steps: 1. Scanning: The black and white photo is first scanned and saved as a digital image. 2. Separating the color channels: The image editing software separates the image into its red, green, and blue (RGB) color channels. 3. Colorizing: Each color channel is then individually colorized by using tools like color adjustment layers, brushes, or gradient maps. This manually adds color to each specific area of the photo. 4. Merging: The color channels are merged back together to form the final color image. The process of colorizing the image accurately can be time-consuming and requires some skill in using the image editing software. Some automated tools also exist that can help speed up the process, but the results may not be as accurate.
Why does everything in the universe seem to want to spin?	"Imagine a bunch of little rubber balls positioned in a loose 3D grid to create a hollow sphere.  If they were in a universe all to themselves, gravity would pull all of them towards the center.  If they were position exactly the same distance apart, they would come together until they formed a perfectly uniform shape when they finally touch, and it wouldn't spin.  Now image that that sphere isn't exactly perfect.  Image just one of those balls is slightly offset.  What is going to happen?  If we image that the ball is slightly ""to the left"" of where it should be, now instead of everything pulled directly to the center, everything is pulled just slightly in that direction.  This little hitch is going to cause the shape not to be completely uniform.  It's still going to pull everything towards the center, but it will also cause everything to spin just a bit in the direction of that non-uniformity. So in the real world, when big giant clouds of hydrogen start to get pulled together by gravity, because the hydrogen isn't uniformly distributed, it starts to spin as it collapses.  Things that spin tend to bulge out on an axis relative to the direction of that spin.  When the inner portion of that cloud reaches a certain density, a star is formed, and that outer bulge gets left behind to solidify into planets.  These planets then orbit around a spinning star, all roughly in the plane of that bulge."	One possible explanation for why everything in the universe seems to want to spin is due to angular momentum. Angular momentum is a property of a rotating object that determines the amount of its rotation. When an object contracts or collapses, it spins faster due to the conservation of angular momentum. This is known as the conservation of angular momentum principle in physics. Since most objects in the universe are formed through a process of collapsing or contracting, they have some initial angular momentum that causes them to spin. Additionally, the motion of spinning objects is naturally stable, meaning they tend to maintain their rotation unless acted upon by an external force. This stability is also a factor in why spinning objects are so common in the universe.
why are Amplified DDOS attacks impossible to mitigate?	Amplified DDOS attack or just amplification attack uses a fault in some systems to make it send more traffic to your attack target then you send out. So imagine you have a 100Mbit internet link and you are able to send a 10 byte packet to DNS servers so that they send a 1000 byte packet to your target. You are then able to force 10Gbit of traffic to the target which they hopefully for you can not handle. And that is only using your home internet connection. If you own a small botnet you may have a collective bandwidth much higher and are able to amplify the attack to great numbers. The problem is that the bandwidth of the systems vulnerable to amplification attacks is greater then most of the core internet infrastructure can handle. So you can actually be able to saturate the links between the biggest ISPs. There is no way to protect against such an attack.	Amplified DDoS attacks are difficult to mitigate because they take advantage of vulnerable systems to create a large volume of traffic overwhelming a targeted system. The attackers often use multiple compromised devices or networks to generate overwhelming traffic volumes that can be difficult to block without disrupting legitimate traffic. Additionally, attackers can leverage new vulnerabilities and bypass traditional security measures, making it challenging for organizations to identify and mitigate the attack in real-time. Thus, mitigating an amplified DDoS attack requires a combination of proactive network security measures, capable infrastructure, and incident response preparedness.
"What exactly does ""Money"" represent? Who decides what it is worth?"	"Nowadays, money does not ""represent"" anything except what you can buy with it. Because governments no longer have laws that let you exchange bills for silver or gold, the value of a dollar is what you can buy with a dollar. It requires a certain amount of trust for money to have value--you've got to trust people are not making fake bills, and you have to trust that the government won't print lots of money and thereby reduce its value. (Because if money is easy to get, people will want to charge you more for their goods and services.) Currencies that people do not trust quickly become worthless paper. So the U.S. dollar has value because it is very widely used, people trust the U.S. government to issue it responsibly, and it is protected from counterfeiting (albeit not perfectly).  >   National debts (why couldn't they all just be wiped) for example. A loan always two sides to it. When the government borrows money, it's making a promise to an investor to pay it back. Say, a worker invests his savings in a long-term bond, so that he will get repaid the money with interest by the time he retires. To ""wipe"" the national debt would be to extend an official middle finger to everyone who that money was borrowed from.  >   Does the $14 in my wallet represent an amount of gold somewhere?  It used to, but it no longer does. Governments still have very large stores of gold, because the stability of the gold price is important to the stability of the economy as a whole, since people still like to invest in gold. But modern currencies are ""fiat,"" that is to say, they have value because the government has established them as legal tender, not because of any inherent value in gold."	Money represents a medium of exchange used to facilitate transactions of goods and services. It is generally accepted by people within a particular economy or region as a means of payment. The value of money is determined by numerous factors, including supply and demand, inflation rates, and economic policies enforced by governments and financial institutions. Generally, central banks or monetary authorities of a country regulate the supply of money by controlling the issuance of currency and setting interest rates. The exchange rate of a currency is determined by the market forces of supply and demand, and it can fluctuate depending on various economic factors and events.
How do some people maintain that certain minerals and rocks give them specific health benefits? How do companies get to profit off that?	"They and other things like them - magnetic bracelets, feng shui, ion baths, ""detoxing"", and so on - are for the most part scams, but they CAN have health benefits even if they're complete bunk. These benefits can come from a couple different sources. First, pampering yourself and believing that you're doing something healthy can reduce your stress. Going to an expensive spa for some sort of oxygen treatment might not actually do much physically for you directly, but it'll reduce your blood pressure and create some happy spoiling-yourself memories, and those can have health benefits. There's also some science that says the colour pink can reduce hostile emotions (they have proven this by putting belligerent arrestees in pink-painted rooms to calm them down), so the Himalayan light might have some reality. Lemon scent is proven to increase productivity in workers, nice decor increases personal contentment, and so on.  So there's often little sidebar benefits to many of these little treatments and doo-dads even if the actual health claims their manufacturers tell us are HORRIBLY exaggerated."	Some people maintain that certain minerals and rocks give them specific health benefits based on traditional beliefs or anecdotal evidence. However, there is often little scientific evidence to support these claims. Companies may profit off these beliefs by marketing dietary supplements or health products containing these minerals or rocks, making claims about their supposed health benefits. This can be misleading and potentially harmful if people rely on these products instead of seeking proper medical care.
Where are the dust particules going after I inhaled them?	Most of them are going to hit the sides of your trachea before they ever reach your lungs.  They'll stick because of the mucus, and then cilia will push them back up to the top of the throat, where they'll probably get swallowed. Any that enter your lungs will be eaten by specialist white blood cells called alveolar macrophages (also called dust cells, for that reason).	When you inhale dust particles, some of them will be filtered out by the hair-like structures called cilia that line your respiratory tract and eventually expelled through coughing or sneezing. However, some particles may be small enough to pass through the cilia and get deep into your lungs, where they can cause irritation, inflammation, and even scarring over time. Some particles, like certain metals or chemicals, can also enter your bloodstream and travel to other parts of your body. It's best to minimize exposure to dust whenever possible to prevent health problems.
If plaque is bacteria from food, why is it white?	"Its a metabolic waste product of the colonized bacteria living in your mouth. Simple carbs are broken down by saliva and the bacteria eat this and therefore produce a waste...Basically the term ""potty mouth"" fits :)  also the reason your breath smells so bad in the morning, they produce this all the time but during waking hours you are eating and drinking and don't notice the buildup. Main reason for brushing and or scraping your tongue daily. I also brush my tongue a few times a week with regular or generic listerine, I prefer green version. Also by brushing with this it is helping to deliver it under the gumline where anaerobic bacteria live and thereby preventing gum diseases. I get wonderful patient compliance when put into these basic terms."	Plaque appears white due to the accumulation of minerals such as calcium and phosphate in the biofilm that forms on teeth. The bacteria in plaque feed on sugars from foods and produce acids that can dissolve the minerals in tooth enamel. Over time, this can lead to cavities and the formation of white or yellowish spots on teeth. Regular brushing and flossing can help remove plaque and prevent further mineral buildup.
When you make Jello, why must you mix the powder with hot water and then add cold water after?	Gelatin in water is a mixture, not a solution, so as you mentioned the hot water dissolves the powder.  If it were just left alone, the more dense gelatin and sugars would settle to the bottom and not crystalize as efficiently.   Cold water essentially shocks the gelatin and creates nucleation sites for the gelatin and sugars to form upon.	When you mix Jello powder with hot water, it dissolves quickly and completely, allowing the gelatin molecules to fully hydrate and absorb the water. Adding cold water after this step helps to cool the mixture down and allows the gel to set properly. If you add cold water to the powder directly, it may not dissolve properly and you may end up with lumps or a gritty texture in the finished product.
how one can be approved for an auto loan, take the car home, then have the bank decide not to finance the car?	You don't get approved at the dealership...you get pre-approved. Typically they give you 72 hours to get final approval, and let you use the car for that time as a courtesy.  It inconveniences them as much as it does you, as they have to roll back all the paperwork and redetail the car.  Plus, if you put too many miles on it, they can no longer sell it as new.	Typically, a bank or lender will not approve someone for an auto loan until they have verified certain criteria, such as credit score, income, and employment history. However, sometimes a pre-approval or conditional approval may be given based on these factors, but the final approval is contingent on additional information. If the bank later determines that the borrower does not meet their lending criteria, they may decide not to finance the car, even after the loan has been approved and the borrower has taken possession of the car. This can happen if the borrower's financial situation changes significantly or if there was any misrepresentation of information during the loan application process.  In such cases, the borrower may be required to return the car or find alternative financing options. It is important to thoroughly review all terms and conditions of a loan agreement before agreeing to the loan.
How can I forget what seems to be a very memorable dream in the span of just a few seconds after waking up?	Dreams do not always make it into long-term memory. They reside in your short-term memory. That's why if you don't hold onto it for more than a few seconds once you wake up, you typically forget it forever. That's why people recommend keeping a dream journal where you immediately write down your dream so you can remember it long-term.	One technique to help remember your dreams is to keep a journal or notepad by your bed and write down your experience as soon as you wake up. However, if you want to forget the dream, you can try distracting yourself with a simple activity such as brushing your teeth or stretching immediately after waking up. It may also help to focus on the present moment and immerse yourself in your daily routine to shift your mind away from the dream.
How the overuse of antibiotics is making them less effective.	edit: for clarity, bacterium is singular and bacteria is plural.  Take a population of bacteria. Each individual bacterium has its own set of genes and sometimes, there will be a mutation causing a new or altered gene to appear. Mutations are rare, but there are millions and millions of bacteria, so they do happen every once in a while. Occasionally, you'll come across a mutant bacterium that has a gene which gives it resistance to a particular antibiotic. So, if you use an antibiotic in this situation, every bacterium *except for* the resistant one will die, leaving only the resistant one free to reproduce and pass on its genes and thus its immunity.  So, if you overuse antibiotics for things that don't really require one (like a cold, which is caused by a virus), then you're creating a situation in which there's evolutionary selection for immunity to antibiotics. By consequence, there will be more and more bacteria that can survive antibiotics causing the antibiotics to become useless.	The overuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. When antibiotics are used frequently or unnecessarily, bacteria can evolve to become resistant to them. These resistant bacteria can then rapidly multiply and spread, making it difficult or impossible to treat infections using standard antibiotic treatments. Additionally, the misuse of antibiotics, such as not completing a full course of treatment, can also contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Thus, it is important to use antibiotics only when necessary and as instructed by a healthcare provider to ensure their effectiveness in treating bacterial infections.
Which part of the US govt is in control of imposing sanctions on other nations? Is it a collaboration of several govt bodies? Does the UN get involved?	Congress as the legislative body is the one that generally imposes sanctions and the President as the head of the Executive enforces them. The Secretary of State as part of the Executive under the President does what he instructs.  But since the President through various ambassadors and the Secretary of State is the entity in charge of negotiating and establishing international agreements he can in theory also impose some sanctions unilaterally, or make the equivalent of sanctions by enforcing various laws already on the books.  Edit: The UN can request that countries make sanctions against a specific country, or they can request that they end sanctions against one but they cannot force any member nation to comply with these requests. Also, no country needs to seek approval of the UN to start or end sanctions.	The United States government controls the imposition of sanctions on other nations. It is predominantly the responsibility of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a part of the US Treasury Department. However, other government agencies like the State Department, Commerce Department, and Justice Department also play a role in establishing and enforcing sanctions. The UN Security Council can also impose sanctions on nations, but this requires collective action and agreement among its member states.
The economy of Audio-books. Why are they so expensive?	"The answer to ""Why does this cost so much?"" is always ""Because enough people are willing to pay that much."" The cost of production only puts a lower limit on the price --beyond which it would be a loss to sell the product.  A lower cost of production opens up the opportunity to sell to a larger audience at a lower price, but that is not necessarily the best price to maximize your profits.  If you are already reaching the the majority of your audience, lowering the price won't result in enough sales to make up the difference."	There are several factors that contribute to the cost of audiobooks. One of the main factors is the production cost involved in recording and editing the audiobook. Recording a high-quality audiobook requires expensive equipment and skilled professionals for the narration and editing process. Additionally, the cost of distribution and licensing fees often add to the overall expense. The price is also influenced by the popularity and demand for the book. High-demand titles can command a higher price due to their popularity and potential for higher sales. However, some audiobook services may offer subscription-based models that can provide access to a large number of audiobooks at a lower cost.
"What dictates the definitions of ""Right-Wing"" and ""Left-Wing""?"	OP, re your edit, yes, 'left' in the US would be 'right' or 'centre right' in most if Europe. I find it truly weird to hear Obama called a socialist. In Ireland most of our conservative politicians are to the left if Obama in terms of his actions, links to business etc (not far to the left mind you, but still...). Your most left elected reps would be considered 'social democrats' here unless I've missed any actual elected US socialists.  Our most left wing elected representatives would be fringe radicals in the states and would be impossible to elect there except maybe (very maybe) on a local level. Our unelected fringe here would be various types of anarchists who focus on community based activism and then there's a mixed bag of protest based groups that span the left/right spectrum but come across similarly to fringe Tea Partiers (only unelectable). Edit: fat fingers and run on sentences.	"The terms ""Right-Wing"" and ""Left-Wing"" refer to political ideologies that developed during the French Revolution of the 18th century. In general, ""Right-Wing"" politics emphasize individualism, traditional values, and free-market capitalism, while ""Left-Wing"" politics emphasize collectivism, social justice, and government intervention in the economy. However, the definitions of these terms can vary depending on the context and country."
"Did Apple and Windows both skip the ""9th update"" coincidentally or is there more to the story?"	iPhone 9 got explained by different comments, but the actual story behind Windows is far more interesting. It seems due to some sloppy programming, there is a bunch of MS applications which are checking the version of OS by verifying if it begins with '9' (to differentiate between Windows 95/98 and later versions, which have a different architecture). So they had to skip Windows 9 because of the risk it would be accidentally treated as an old Windows version by some apps, causing compatibility issues.	Apple and Windows both skipped the 9th update in their operating systems for different reasons. Apple skipped the 9th update for macOS (previously known as OS X) as a tribute to the classic Mac OS 9, which was the final version of the older operating system. Windows skipped the 9th update (Windows 9) and went directly to Windows 10 due to compatibility issues with legacy software that was written to detect Windows 95 and 98 by their version number. Skipping from Windows 8 to Windows 10 avoided this potential issue.
"How Did Homeopathy Gain Ground as a ""Viable"" Treatment?"	Bogus treatments have existed for a long time. Point is, many people are themselves not scientifically literate to judge the efficiency or sensibility of a medicine. They thus rely on thevinformation of others. Thus, when seemingly credible people advertize it as if it works, they believe them. Combine that with the placebo effect, and a growing distrust of big pharma...	"Homeopathy gained ground as a ""viable"" treatment option through the efforts of its founder, Samuel Hahnemann, and his followers. They promoted it as a gentle, natural, and effective alternative to the harsh medical practices of the time. Homeopathy also gained popularity because it was affordable, accessible, and easy to administer. The spread of homeopathy was also aided by the fact that it offered hope and relief to many people who had not found satisfactory treatment through conventional medicine. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of homeopathy has been widely debated among the scientific and medical communities."
Why can we instantly feel the pain of a minor injury (cuts, bruises, pricks etc.) whereas in some cases it can take several minutes before feeling the pain of a major injury (fractures, tears etc.)?	I'm going to have to disagree with the other answers. It has to do with your stress response and that's really it. Nerve conduction is just way too fast for any of its variations to play a role in this. And although it's true that you have more nerve endings in your skin than some places internally, that doesn't change the fact that breaking a bone is excruciatingly painful. The real answer here is that it's subjective. There is no real difference in the timing of the pain, but you are much more likely to be under a stress response when you have a major injury. When you have a stress response a ton of things happen that are pretty much categorized under a sympathetic nervous response. Part of that are cascades of hormones and neurotransmitters that block pain, constrict blood vessels, increase heart rate, etc. When under a stress response you feel less pain sensation, regardless of where it's coming from. To contrast, if you are at home chopping onions and slice the end of your finger, well you get no endorphins, no catecholamines, none of those neurotransmitters that buffer the pain response. If you could break a leg without a massive stress response, it would objectively hurt a lot more than what you imagine that minor injury feels like. It's all subjective.	The reason for this is due to the way our nervous system works. Minor injuries like cuts and bruises stimulate the pain receptors in our skin, which send a signal to the brain via the spinal cord. This signal is transmitted rapidly, resulting in an immediate feeling of pain. In contrast, major injuries like fractures and tears may initially cause numbness due to the damage to nerve fibers that transmit pain signals. Additionally, the body may release natural painkillers in response to the injury which can temporarily reduce the sensation of pain. However, as the injury progresses and inflammation sets in, the pain receptors become activated and send signals to the brain, resulting in the delayed feeling of pain.
how time is considered a dimension of space.	This is all semantics to some extent, but it's still probably much more meaningful to say that time is a dimension of *spacetime*. Time *isn't* space, space *isn't* time, but the two are connected in interesting ways that means you can't manipulate one without manipulating the other. It all comes down to one of the main premises of relativity; the speed of light is the same in all reference frames. Once you take that idea and run with it, you need some way to relate different velocity frames given that you can't just add velocities any more of the speed of light will change. It turns out that Lorentz transforms can do that for you. By expressing time and space as a single set of variables (in the notation, we use 4-vectors), you can apply your Lorentz transform and see what happens. When you do all the maths and get everything working consistently, you get results like the way time may pass at different rates in different frames. Our intuition also gets nicely mucked up by things like the relativity of simultaneity not actually being real - if two things are simultaneous to one person, another person may see them happen at different times. This isn't because time *is* a dimension of space, it's because time and space are both related as parts of overall spacetime. Or at least, that's how we describe it.	Time is considered a dimension of space in the sense that, when combined with the three dimensions of space (length, width, and height), it forms the four-dimensional space-time continuum. In this framework, time is treated as a dimension in the same way as space dimensions, and it is represented in mathematical models as a fourth dimension. This concept was first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity. It has important implications in physics, particularly in the study of space-time geometry, cosmic time, and the behavior of particles that travel near the speed of light.
Why does putting salt on food make it excrete some of the water it contains?	OSMOSIS BABY! Essentially, the way cells work is that water is allowed to leak in and out.  Water will diffuse in and out of a cell (or any other permeable membrane) towards the side of highest salt concentration. Thus when you increase the salt concentration outside the cell, the water in those cells diffuses out.  Performed en masse, you get the leaking that happens when you salt an eggplant or tomatoes or whatever the heck you're salting.	When salt is added to food, it creates a high concentration of sodium ions outside the food cells, which causes osmosis. Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane (such as the cell wall of food) from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration. So, the salt draws the water out of the cells of the food, causing it to lose some of its water content, making it drier and more concentrated in flavor.
How does my modem or my iPhone retain my settings, even when unplugged or out of battery?	The technical terms are *Volatile* and *Non-Volatile* memory.  Volatile memory is very fast when you read and write from it, but needs a constant power source to refresh itself. Non-Volatile is slower, but once written to it stays that way until it's changed. So the RAM, or working memory, in a computer or phone, is volatile, fast memory. But there is a permanent storage, where basic information is stored. Generally, when a device turns on, the permanent memory has instructions for start up, and it loads things into the working memory to get going.	Your modem or iPhone retains your settings through non-volatile memory (NVRAM), which is a type of memory that can retain data even when the device is not powered on. This means that your settings are stored in a special area of memory that is designed to maintain its contents for a long time, even in the absence of an electrical charge. NVRAM is commonly used in electronic devices for storing configuration settings like your Wi-Fi network name and password, as well as your user preferences such as brightness, volume and language settings.
Why and how did the economic depression in 2008/2009 start	In short, the banks were selling mortgages to people who basically couldn't afford it. They did this because of incompetence from rating agency who looked at these loans and due to some clever misdirection from the banks, thought that these loans were golden (ie could easily be paid off).  From this, banks who knew they were crap convinced other banks to insure them against this debt.  1) So essentially we had banks giving out loans it knew wouldn't get paid back 2) Due to incompetence , these banks were able to wrap up these loans in 'gold' and convince other banks and insurers to buy them. 3) When people finally realised that all this debt was crap, the people who couldn't afford the mortgages defaulted and the insurance companies and banks had to pay out on the insurance they had given out. 4) No one had any money left 5) depression	The Great Recession of 2008/2009 was triggered by a combination of factors, including the housing market crash, high levels of subprime lending, and excessive risk-taking by financial institutions. In the years leading up to the recession, banks were offering loans to people with poor credit histories, which created a housing bubble. Once the housing market began to decline, many homeowners found themselves with houses worth less than their mortgages, resulting in a wave of foreclosures. Financial institutions that had invested heavily in these mortgage-backed securities faced significant losses, causing a shock to the financial system that ultimately spread into the broader economy. The recession lasted until 2009 and led to widespread job losses and a decline in economic growth worldwide.
How do spam telemarketers make money since almost everyone just hangs up?	Currently sitting at my desk working as an IT for a fundraising call center.   & nbsp; Step one: Dialing systems. I'm actually in the process of compiling data to better configure our rate of dial or CPA (calls per agent). As more people wait to get connected to someone, more calls are made. My goal atm, is to have my agents wait no longer than 30s between calls, but also make sure there are no drops (when you pick up and no one is there. Everyone hates that.)This is just getting people to pick up. lets say on average 35% of people pick up the phone.   & nbsp; Step 2: People hang up, many do. But, many don't however. Also it's illegal to call cellphones, so generally people at home on lan lines are more likely to be available to talk. Now this where the product often comes in to play. The company I work for does fundraising for things like breast cancer etc. Something more people are willing to hear about than say a TV salesman.   & nbsp; Step 3: Percentage of donation, this is mainly just for fundraisers. Like any business you have to pay your employees and overhead etc. The server room, dialer software, support, custom databases etc arent cheap (although 2 of my computers use win98 and XP). Hell my salary and I maybe do about 10 hours of real work a week praying the system/database doesn't crash. But they need to pay me just like any other business because if it does their SOL without me. You often hear people complain about these companies that alot is payed to fundraisers. Why do they do it? 20% of a large large pie, is a lot better than 100% of a small pie. A recent article was recently written about my company, and it was funny despite all the poor remarks, at the very bottom the paper inserted the bottom line comment from the fundraiser that they've raised over 40 times the amount of money for their charity by utilizing telemarketers, compared to just raising locally with volunteers.   & nbsp; If anyone has any questions I can give some insight. Not as bad of a service than people think, at least with fundraising I should say my expertise is limited to.	Spam telemarketers often use automated calling systems to make thousands of calls per day with the hope that some people will answer and engage in the call. They also use deceitful tactics, like pretending to be from a reputable company or offering unrealistic deals, to try and convince people to provide personal information or make a purchase. Some telemarketers may also sell the information they've collected to third-party companies for marketing purposes. Some people may also fall victim to scams, leading to financial gain for the telemarketers.
how do they print vinyl-records? Is it basicly like putting a print on a shirt for example?	so sound vibrates the needle when recording the first press, usually on a wax record.  the band plays or singer sings and the sound waves are converted to vibrations of the needle which forms a grooved track. then the wax print is made into a vinyl one and played on your turn table where the groove makes the needle vibrate which is then converted to sound waves (in modern turn tables this is done digitally but old fashioned ones literally vibrated a rod that emitted the sound). so to print mass numbers of vinyl records you would have a machine that etches the same grooved pattern into the millions of blank disks you fed into it. one imagines in the modern era you don't need to make wax prints but thats how it was done before computers could record the vibrations digitally.	Printing vinyl records involves a different process than printing on fabric such as a shirt. Vinyl records are created by first cutting grooves onto a master disc using a lathe machine. The master disc is then electroplated with metal to create a stamper, which is used to mold the final vinyl records. The vinyl material is heated and pressed between the two stampers to create the final product. The printing of labels and artwork onto vinyl records is done separately using a printing press to apply ink to the paper label or directly onto the vinyl surface.
What are EDM DJs actually doing up on stage when performing live?	Entertaining! A good deal of it is a show. By looking really busy people buy into the illusion.  (Ultimately they are just playing music other musicians created most of the time) they just pick song orders they like and throw on some auto tunes. I exaggerate of course...but just barely.   It also depends on the DJ.  Some genuinely create original content. But to be a DJ you don’t have to be a musician, song writer etc...   Some have entire tracks planned. And overlay other noises/sounds on top as desired. Volume controls. Wave and other electronic noise controls.   But mostly they have colorful buttons that make whatever noise they want when it’s pressed.   Memorizing patterns that they determined is really the majority of what they do. And change songs based on the mood of the crowd.    Another part of what they do is boost the bass to the point of distortion, and pick moments to do excessive bass drops and such things.	EDM DJs are typically mixing and blending different tracks together, using specialized DJ software and hardware, such as turntables or controllers. They may also be manipulating the music by adjusting the volume, EQ, tempo, and effects in real-time to create a unique and seamless performance. Additionally, some DJs may incorporate live instruments or vocals into their sets. The visual aspects of their performances may also involve lighting, imagery, and pyrotechnics to enhance the overall experience.
Why do air fares go up as the date of the journey nears?	"It's just the pricing model nearly every airline uses, without delving to deep into the economics of it, the demand for a flight gets less flexible the closer to the date the plan to go is made. Here is the example. A family of four probably plans a vacation months if not more in advanced. Thus they have many many options about where to go and how to get there. So because they have so many options (train, driving, other airlines, etc) the airline has to offer cheap rates in order to attract their buisness. This is as opposed to someone who only learns they need to get somewhere the night before. Obviously it might be to far to drive/train in time, this means they have fewer options and thus are forced into flying. Because there are fewer options the airline doesn't need to compete and can charge more. This is aggravated by the fact that the type of person who finds out on a Tuesday that they need to be somewhere super important Wednesday is probably like a high powered business type where the amount of money charged is less important. **tl;dr: as the date approaches there is less competition so they can 'get away with charging more' plus people who are ""on call"" to suddenly travel by plane tend to be less worried about price.**"	Air fares tend to go up as the date of the journey nears because airlines usually adjust their prices based on supply and demand. As the departure date approaches, the number of available seats on a flight tends to decrease, which leads to an increase in demand. Airlines try to maximize their profits by increasing the price of the remaining seats, especially if they are in high demand. Additionally, airlines also use data and analytics to forecast demand, and tend to increase prices as their projected demand for a particular flight increases.
What is the difference between a normal derivative and deriving on a particular point of a function?	"On nice functions you can apply normal rules for derivatives to get a value or a function describing the derivative *everywhere* ( if you get a function and not a constant as result, you just insert the point you want to know the derivative of in the function to know the derivative of that location. But all functions are not so nice, some functions don't have an analytic description of their derivative, then you can go back to the definition of derivative and calculate it on a point, i.e. look at the value difference if you take a small step h forward, divided by the step length, then make h as small as you can without becoming zero. As to deciding where to derive it, you probably have a reason why you need to calculate this derivative, from that reason it should be obvious (although the answer may be ""every point"") - if you don't know where you need the derivative, I don't know why you'd want to calculate it in the first place!"	The normal derivative of a function at a point represents the rate of change of the function at that point, whereas deriving on a particular point of a function involves finding the value of the derivative of the function at that point. In other words, the normal derivative gives the slope of the tangent line to the function at the given point while deriving on a particular point gives the instantaneous rate of change or slope of the function exactly at that point.
How does camouflage work on ships?	You don't really camoflage ships at all. It is rare to spot them visually, normally they are detected by radar and sonar systems so giving them camouflage painting is for the most part pointless. Ships use the sheer size of the ocean to stay hidden as long as possible by sailing to different spots outside of radar/sonar range and approaching from unexpected directions.	Camouflage on ships works by using paint and other materials that blend in with the specific environment around them, such as the ocean or coastline. This helps to conceal the ship from other vessels or aircraft that may be looking for it. Some camouflage patterns also use disruptive shapes or designs to confuse the observer's eye and make it harder to identify the ship's shape and size. In addition, modern ships may use technologies like radar-absorbing materials or infrared shielding to further reduce their detectability.
Why is there a feeling of waves still hitting you, after you've gotten out of the ocean?	Because your body became accustomed to the waves constantly moving it around in the water. Your body was constantly trying to keep its balance by swaying in the opposite direction the waves are pushing for a longgggg time. So, when you get out of the water, your body is still accustomed to having to balance itself so your balance feels swayed on land.	"This feeling is known as ""sea legs"" or ""land sickness"" and is caused by a disruption in the normal balance and sensory input of the body's vestibular system (the sensory system that helps us maintain our balance and orientation). The constant movement of the waves in the ocean can cause the brain to adapt and compensate for the movement. When you get out of the water, the brain still expects that movement, causing a sensation of waves still hitting you, even though you are no longer in the water. This feeling usually lasts for a few hours to a few days before the brain adjusts back to the normal sensory input on land."
Does the camera take a photo of a specific point in time? If so why we never get pictures of a deal room when taking pictures inside the house in the night if the light bulb is flickering?	Two reasons. First, a lightbulb is typically always producing light while it is on (since it is generating light from heat, and maintains a temperature that produces light even while an alternating current might turn off at a given instant in order to change current direction) so it is typically generating light at a constant rate. Some bulbs (like florescent lights) actually do technically flicker from what I understand, but they flicker so fast our eyes cannot detect it unless it starts to wear out and flick off for longer periods. But the main reason is exposure time. No camera captures only a single instant of time - the expose time gives the camera a chance to collect light. Normal exposure times are very short, so appear near-instantaneous, but anything moving fast enough will seem to blur in a photograph. Some cameras can be adjusted to have even longer exposure times so they can collect more light, getting more vibrant colors, detecting dimmer sources of light such as distant stars, or actively utilizing the blurring effect of moving targets.	Yes, a camera captures a specific point in time. However, in low light situations like inside a house at night with a flickering light bulb, the camera's sensor may not be able to capture enough light in the short period of time the shutter is open, resulting in a blurry or dark image. In this situation, it may be helpful to use a tripod to stabilize the camera and let it capture more light over a longer exposure time, or to use external lighting to provide more light for the camera to capture.
When people get hanged in movies, what kills them?	So hanging has a few possible things, it was actually a highly respected  &  professional profession in Britain. The length of the rope, and length of the drop were calculated according to the weight of the person. Too short and the fall wouldn't break the neck, too long and you risked either the rope snapping, or the head being ripped clean (ok, not so clean) off.	When a person is hanged in movies, it is typically depicted as their neck breaking and severing the spinal cord, resulting in immediate death. Sometimes it can also result in death due to asphyxiation. However, it is important to note that hanging is a cruel, inhumane and illegal method of execution and should not be used in any circumstance.
How do laptops tell what percentage of a battery is remaining and when a laptop (or any device) is going to run out of juice?	"Lets say batteries are full of electricity and electricity is made of 5 year olds - thousands of them. When your laptop turns on, the kids are told to run outside the battery and into the laptop. The door to the laptop has a person that counts the number of kids going into the battery. This person records exactly how many kids run through the door into the laptop. This person also knows how many kids ran through the door into the battery. So, we know how many people are in the battery. We also know how many people are leaving the battery. If we have a stop watch, we can measure how fast people are leaving to know how long it will be until the battery is empty. Now, sometimes the counter gets the numbers wrong. That's okay because we can still get really close. So what we do is over estimate. We also adjust the numbers at key times (when the battery is fully charged, the number of kids in the battery must be full). ----- In grown up terms, devices use coulomb counting to calculate state of charge. Because coulomb counting drifts over time (counter can't catch everyone), we dead reckon at certain known states (example: a full battery). We can use a fair bit of math to determine battery wear - permanent loss of capacity. Many devices use lithium-ion battery chemistry. Unfortunately for people trying to track battery state, the voltage is fairly flat as the battery is discharged. That is to say, unlike other batteries, lithium batteries don't have a big voltage change for most of their usable charge. When these batteries are near empty there is a ""knee"" as the battery voltage drops quickly. This is why you can sometimes see a sudden drop in battery capacity (the coulomb counting drifted too far and suddenly the battery is near dead). Finally, consumer devices, generally speaking, lie to you. We'll intentionally over or under report values to get the user behavior we want while balancing user experience."	Laptops use a battery management system (BMS) that continuously monitors the battery's voltage, current, and temperature to estimate its remaining capacity and predict the time left until it runs out of charge. The BMS uses a mathematical model that takes into account the battery's discharge characteristics, age, and usage patterns to make these predictions. The battery capacity is also reported to the operating system, which displays the remaining charge in percentage and estimated time remaining based on the BMS information. Many laptops also provide power-saving features that can help conserve battery life and extend the time between charges.
Why does car sickness seem to hit the hardest when you look down at your phone, book, etc.?	There are a few different causes for motion sickness, but one very common cause is the disconnect between the motion your body feels and the motion your eyes see.  When you're in a moving car, your body feels the motion, if you closed your eyes you'd know you were moving by the sensations on your body and a special configuration of your inner ear that can detect motion.  However, if you are a passenger and you are only focusing your eyes on something inside the car, your eyes don't see the motion your body feels. This disconnect between different sensations of motion and non-motion creates a confusing sense of movement in your brain, which can cause nausea if it goes on long enough.  If you focus on something outside the car, your eyes and your body's other senses of motion have similar experiences of movement, so the disconnect doesn't happen.  People who are prone to this type of motion sickness can experience similar motion sickness if they watch a movie with lots of camera movement, because their eyes are seeing motion while their body doesn't sense it.	Looking down at a phone, book, or other device can cause conflicting signals to the brain. When you're riding in a car, your inner ear senses motion while your eyes are focused on a stationary object. This disagreement between what your inner ear feels and what your eyes see can lead to motion sickness. When you look down at your phone or book, your brain receives even more conflicting signals, which can exacerbate feelings of nausea and discomfort.
In mathematics and programming what is a type system? Confused.	"A ""type"" is the kind of thing something is. A flat head screwdriver is a type of screw driver; a screw driver is a type of tool; a tool is a type of object; etc. In programming languages (""type systems""), we have to tell the computer what kind of data the binary is representing. This is handled by the type system of the programming language. We (usually) don't want to use a sentence as a number or a game character as a piece of code. The type system allows us to say what kind of thing each bit of binary is, and have the compiler enforce this for us, by complaining when we use them wrong. In mathematics, a ""type theory"" tells us the type of thing mathematical objects are. A number can be a natural number or a rational number or a real number. Some values are just true or false. It serves as a way to be specific what we're talking about, which is why it comes up as an alternative to set theory - which is another way to be specific about what we're talking about. (Both type theory and set theory make you define math objects a certain way, and have rules - called axioms - for manipulating them or making new things.)"	A type system is a set of rules and constraints that govern the type of data that can be used in a programming language or mathematical system. It ensures that operations are performed correctly and consistently while maintaining the integrity of the data. A type system can also aid in detecting errors and bugs early on, making it an important tool for software development. Different programming languages can use different type systems, with some being more strict or flexible than others.
Why is an hour divided into 60 minutes and not a different number? How did they decide this?	Putting 24 hours in a day came from the ancient Egyptians who split things up into 12, so there was a 12 hour day and 12 hour night. The 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute comes from the ancient Babylonians who liked to split things in base 60 (they had a thing for the number 360 because they thought that's how many days there were in year). Basically, people have been keeping time in these increments since ancient history and it's stuck around since then.	The concept of dividing time into sixty-minute increments originated in ancient Sumer and Babylon around 2000 BCE. This system was later adopted by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. It is believed that these early civilizations chose 60 as the base number for time measurement because it is divisible by so many other numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30), which made complex time calculations much easier. The use of a sexagesimal system (base 60) for time measurement was eventually adopted by the Roman Empire, and it has remained in use in most of the world ever since.
Why do they land the Falcon 9 on a ship instead of on land?	Sure, but barges are safer because you can easily put them away from anything valuable. And if the rocket misses it just lands in water rather than smashing on land. You can also move your pad anywhere, including the most fuel efficient locations on the equator of the Earth's spin, or international waters so you don't need to worry about governments telling you what you can launch.	There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, not all launches occur in the same place, so having a landing platform at every location would be difficult and costly. Additionally, some launches require a greater deal of fuel, which means the rocket needs to attain a higher altitude and travel at a faster speed before returning to Earth. Landing on a ship allows for the rocket to have more fuel to work with, and the ship can be positioned in a more optimal location for the rocket's trajectory. Lastly, landing on a ship can be safer than landing on land, as the landing platform can be moved away from populated areas and there is less risk of debris or damage to infrastructure.
Why nuclear power stations using thorium are better.	"Thorium doesn't make a power station better. In fact, trying to use thorium in our existing reactors turns out to be more difficult and much less efficient. The concept I think you are talking about is the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor, which is a Molten Salt Reactor that uses Thorium as its fuel.  Thorium alone doesn't make the reactor design great, its the MSR type reactor design which has benefits. The first, is because the fuel is already melted, and does not require high pressure containers, there is no concept of a ""melt down"". In current reactor fuel, the radioactive waste is sealed in rods under very high pressure, which can over heat, melt, and release their radioactivity. In the LFTR design, the fuel is already melted and is at low pressure, so it cannot easily escape the reactor and get to the outside during an accident. The LFTR design can breed its own fuel. Current reactor designs only use a small fraction of the fuel material, while a LFTR type reactor (or any breeder reactor), can utilize virtually ALL the fuel. This is over 20 times the energy density of the fuel in conventional nuclear reactors. The LFTR design is immune to a loss of cooling. If cooling is lost, or the reactor heats up too much, there is a special plug that melts away. The radioactive fuel drains to a different tank which is designed to keep the fuel shut down, and to passively cool it without electricity. Now the bad things about the LFTR design (and MSRs). They use highly corrosive salts, and eat through most common materials easily, so special materials need to be used to contain them, and a lot of research needs to be done. They are still at the conceptual phase. They aren't technically or physically difficult like nuclear fusion is, but, the engineering hasn't been done to produce a plant design, and there are still a lot of technical unknowns. Another important item is that no regulatory structure in the world is set up to deal with molten nuclear fuel, only solid fuel. All new regulations and technical basis would need to be made, and in today's regulatory environment towards nuclear, this will cost in the billions of dollars range between the regulator and the reactor developer before any government could even consider licensing one. Thorium on its own, kind of shit. Thorium in a LFTR design, pretty good."	There are several reasons why nuclear power stations using thorium might be considered better: 1. Thorium is more abundant than uranium and can be found in many countries, reducing dependence on foreign sources. 2. Thorium reactors produce less nuclear waste and the waste produced is less radioactive and has a shorter half-life. 3. Thorium reactors are less prone to nuclear accidents and meltdowns as they work using a different process to conventional reactors. 4. Thorium reactors are more fuel-efficient and require less fuel than conventional reactors, reducing cost and reducing the environmental impact of mining for fuel. Overall, thorium reactors present a promising alternative to conventional nuclear power generation with potential benefits in safety, cost, and environmental impact. However, the technology is still in development and has yet to achieve commercial viability.
Why do slow motion cameras need so much light. Even in broad daylight it looks like night time.	Slow motion camera works by capturing images at very very fast speed; say 1000 frames per second (fps) instead of say 30 fps. This means that the exposure that the sensor has for each frame is only 1/1000 of a second for a 1000fps example. When the exposure is so short, the amount of light that the sensor sees is very little, hence why it appears darker and needs more lighting to compensate.	Slow motion cameras record more frames per second than normal cameras, so they need a higher shutter speed to capture each individual frame. This means that less light is able to reach the camera's sensor, resulting in darker footage. To compensate for this, slow motion cameras need extra light to ensure that the footage is bright enough to see. This is true even in daylight because the high shutter speed reduces the amount of light that reaches the camera.
What's happening when you take a pill, but it feels like it's caught in the back of your throat?	A few possibilities.  1. The pill actually is lodged. Fairly uncommon but some people have difficulties swallowing pills. 2. The pill rubbed/scratched against the back of your throat and you're feeling that, not the pill. 3. Psychosomatic. There's no pill but the thought/idea/fear of the pill getting lodged is causing the sensation.	When a pill feels like it's caught in the back of your throat, it's likely that the pill is not properly positioned to be swallowed. Sometimes this can be due to the size or shape of the pill, while in other cases, it may be due to a dry mouth or lack of sufficient water to wash the pill down. The pill may also dissolve too slowly and get stuck. It's important to drink plenty of water and swallow the pill in an upright position to ensure it goes down smoothly. If you continue to experience difficulty swallowing pills, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for alternative options.
Why do children find pirates so interesting?	"Because our romanticized image of pirates is awesome? We generally leave out the scurvy, gory realities of fighting (even though missing limbs are inextricably part of it already), and the fact that they were thugs on par with organized crime today. Show little kids *Master and Commander* to let them form their idea of the ""wooden ships and iron men"" era and it might be a different story."	Children find pirates interesting because they are often portrayed as adventurous, rebellious, and brave characters. The idea of living on a ship, exploring new lands, and discovering treasure appeals to a child's sense of adventure and imagination. Additionally, pirates are often depicted as having their own codes of honor and justice, which can be appealing to young children who are learning about the importance of fairness and doing what is right.
How do skyscrapers drain rain water?	"The roofs on top of large buildings aren't flat. They're mostly flat, but they're not perfectly flat. Typically, each section of the roof forms a shallow bowl, and at the center of each ""bowl"" is a drain. The rain flows down these drains, which pass through the building (often with very large pipes) and into the urban storm drain system at or below the ground."	Skyscrapers usually have a complex drainage system installed within the building, which helps them to drain rainwater efficiently. The system comprises of various components such as gutters, downspouts, and pipes, which collect the rainwater from the rooftop and store it in storage tanks. The stored water can be used for various purposes such as irrigation, cleaning, and flushing of toilets. Additionally, some skyscrapers employ green roofs, which are covered in vegetation, and they help to absorb and retain rainwater. These methods help to reduce the burden on city drainage systems and conserve water resources.
What is the scientific explanation behind Wim Hof, the iceman?	He is someone who trained himself to withstand cold temperatures. There is nothing about that which needs further explanation; runners can run far longer than most people, gymnasts can tumble in amazing ways, and people who train to be in the cold can do so to a great extent. That is all there is to it.	"Wim Hof, also known as ""The Iceman,"" is known for his ability to tolerate extreme cold temperatures and his unique breathing techniques. According to scientific studies, his breathing technique which involves deep and slow breaths followed by holding your breath, can increase adrenaline, lower carbon dioxide levels and increase oxygen levels in the body. This can lead to a higher threshold for pain and discomfort, improved immune response, and reduced inflammation levels. Additionally, Hof has developed a unique ability to control his autonomic nervous system which is typically involuntary, allowing him to withstand extreme temperatures for extended periods of time."
what is dyslexia, how does it work, and how do you know if you have it?	Dyslexia is a learning disability.  Most people associate it with words or letters moving on the page when the person with dyslexia tries to read.  I have dyslexia, but do not experience this sensation.  Signs of dyslexia are not being able to tell the difference between b's and d's, trouble learning to read, difficulty spelling, confusing left and right, writing letters or numbers backwards.  It is not curable, but can be overcome.   For me overcoming my disability was all about little tricks to help ingrain things into my mind.  For instance, in high school I still could not tell left from right, so I started wearing a bracelet on my right hand and wore it for several years until I automatically remembered.  I still sometimes imagine the bracelet on my hand in order to remember.	Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects a person's ability to read accurately and fluently. This can also affect writing, spelling, and other language-based tasks. It typically stems from differences in the way the brain processes language. People with dyslexia may have difficulty recognizing and decoding words, as well as trouble with phonological awareness (identifying and manipulating the sounds in words). They may also struggle with reading comprehension, word retrieval, and writing. Some common signs of dyslexia include slow or inaccurate reading, difficulty with spelling and writing, difficulty with phonological awareness, trouble with memory and sequencing, and avoidance of reading or other language-based tasks. A formal evaluation by a trained professional is usually necessary to diagnose dyslexia.
When does an elected government become a regime?	"""Regime"" simply means ""system of government""; if we change the question slightly, we can ask at what point does a democratically elected government stop being a democratic government and start being a dictatorship? Cynically, you could say that any government you are ideologically opposed to is, for you, a ""dictatorship"". But let's leave spin and propaganda out of this. Probably the simplest way to define a dictatorship is one where there is, short of an armed uprising, no way for the population to remove the regime -- that is, there are no elections; or if there are any, they are not free or fair. If we take, for example, Nazi Germany, a classic case of the electorate voting in a regime that ended up being a totalitarian dictatorship. This was in March 1933, and although the NSDAP -- the Nazi Party -- won most of the seats in the Reichstag, they didn't get an absolute majority (that is, more people actually voted against the Nazis than voted for them). Fair enough. But then the Communist Party was declared illegal and their seats void, giving the Nazis an absolute majority after all. They then pushed through an Enabling Act, granting them temporary extra powers -- although they still had to make false promises to one of the other parties and post armed guards in the debating chamber to ensure the vote went the right way. Armed with this Enabling Act, the terms of which they almost immediately broke, the Nazis were able to ban all other parties and pass a law outlawing the creation of new political parties. And just to put the cherry on the cake, Adolf Hitler assumed the role of head of state in addition to his role as head of government, a highly illegal move but by now there was nobody left to protest. The next elections were held in November of that year. The only party represented on the ballot paper was the Nazi party, along with a few other independent candidates which were called ""guests"". At this point, the German population had no way of voting the government out, and the Nazis had no opposition in parliament, making it redundant. By now, Germany was a single-party state, with the business of parliament being taken care of by the government (and therefore by the party), and so very clearly a dictatorship."	An elected government becomes a regime when it starts to misuse its power, suppress opposition, and violate human rights. When an elected government disregards the democratic norms and principles, and begins to use force and violence to maintain its power, it can be considered a regime. Essentially, a regime is a government that maintains power through authoritarian or totalitarian means, and does not respect the will of the people.
For MMO players, why does equipping items generally bind them to you so they can no longer be traded?	1. they don't want to create a secondary economy where you can easily sell items for cash.   2. it makes the item more rare, more prestigious to get 3. without a viable way to destroy the items, you just end up having an excess and the in game economy becomes worthless.   eve online is a great example of how everything is tradable.  but then again, the big thing in eve online is that you will lose your stuff, a lot.  but in MMO's like wow or others, once you get an item, it'll never become destroyed.	Equipping items in an MMO game generally binds them to you so that they cannot be traded because it helps to preserve the balance of the game economy and prevent the abuse of trade systems. If items could be freely traded after being equipped, players could constantly switch and share their most powerful items, causing an imbalance and devaluing the effort required to obtain those items. By binding equipped items to the player who possesses them, the game can maintain a fair distribution of valuable items and prevent any one player from gaining an undue advantage.
Why is Mother's Day Tommorow? Do something significant happen to mark it as Mothers Day?	"In the US, Mother's Day celebrations were first practiced as a sort of ""peace and reconciliation"" holiday for the mothers who had lost sons on opposite sides of the Civil War.  Ann Jarvis first held a ""Mother's Friendship Day"" and tried popularizing it in 1868, but died in 1905 before it really caught on outside of a few locales.   In 1877, because of a dispute between temperance and anti-temperance groups where some anti-temperance goons forced some prohibitionists to get publicly drunk, which caused a Reverend to get all verclempt, as his sons were among those involuntarily intoxicated, and become unable to finish his sermon, a woman jumped to his defense to finish his sermon for him, and called on mothers to join the temperance movement.  In gratitude, the sons began a campaign to return to the town and pay tribute to her every year on the second Sunday in May, and urged their business contacts to do likewise.  In 1910, Ann Jarvis's daughter, Anna Jarvis, got West Virginia to recognize Mother's Day as a holiday, and other states quickly followed suit.  In 1914, Congress passed a resolution declaring the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day, and requested a proclamation, and the next day, President Wilson proclaimed the first national Mother's Day."	Mother's Day is celebrated tomorrow as it is observed annually on the second Sunday of May in many countries across the world. The day honors mothers, motherhood, maternal bonds, and the influence of mothers in society. The holiday has been celebrated since the early 20th century, with various origins and traditions. It is a day to show appreciation and gratitude towards mothers and everything they do for their families.
Why is it that the fear of a US Government shutdown has mostly disintegrated following Boehner announcing his departure as speaker?	The push towards a shutdown over planned parenthood was being driven by a contingent of the GOP that wants a number of things, one of which is Boehner not being speaker any more. So instead of giving them their fight over planned parenthood, Boehner gave them him being gone.  This doesn't mean that they'll give up on their planned parenthood stuff, but it does mean that at least for the short term, they're happy. And even if they're not, Boehner can pass a temporary budget relying on help from democrats in the house. If he wasn't planning on leaving, this would be tougher, because it would likely cause that same GOP contingent to try to get him kicked out. But since he's leaving anyways, he can cut deals with the democrats without caring about consequences for his position.	The fear of a US Government shutdown has mostly dissipated following Boehner's announcement of his resignation as Speaker because he was the one leading the charge against compromise with the Senate and Democratic Party. With Boehner stepping down, there is now a chance that a more moderate Republican may take his place and be willing to work across the aisle to prevent a government shutdown. Additionally, Boehner's resignation has led to speculation that Congress may pass a short-term funding bill to avoid a shutdown until a new Speaker is elected and a long-term budget agreement can be reached.
Why is it not possible to test for a deficiency in dopamine or serotonin instead of the current practice of trying several psychiatric medications until you find a method of action that works?	Depression is typically associated with specific parts of the brain acting differently. When you're trying to test the brain, you're running into trouble with the blood-brain barrier, so normal blood tests aren't helpful. In order to measure the brain's environment we generally use lumbar punctures to test the composition of cerebrospinal fluid. However, neurotransmitters don't really drift very far from where they're released, that's kind of the point. A whole mess of stuff tries to scoop up and breakdown neurotransmitters before they drift too far away, otherwise they'd be triggering the wrong neurons. And CSF is typically sampled from well down your spine, far away from where your brain is doing stuff. Neurotransmitter levels aren't a passive thing like white blood cells or something. It's more like a signal rate and the signals are in your brain where it's hard to test and, chemically, they're very localized.	It is not possible to directly test for a deficiency in dopamine or serotonin because the levels of these neurotransmitters fluctuate constantly and their production and regulation are regulated by numerous complex systems in the brain. The current practice of trying different psychiatric medications is based on trial and error, as well as the individual's response to the medication. This is because psychiatric medications can affect multiple neurotransmitters and pathways in the brain, and what works for one individual may not work for another. Additionally, psychiatric disorders are often complex, and there may be other factors involved beyond neurotransmitter imbalances. Research in this area is ongoing, but currently, there is no single test or method of determining the specific cause of a psychiatric disorder.
Why do people hold their heads when something surprising/unbelievable happens? Is this a defence mechanism?	I've heard that people cover their mouths when something shocking happens because they are subconsciously trying to slow their breathing by increasing the CO2 concentration in their inhaled breath. Bit like breathing into a paper bag when you are hyperventilating. I know it's not what OP asked but thought it was interesting anyway.	The gesture of holding one's head when something surprising or unbelievable happens may be a natural response to the cognitive dissonance that occurs when our expectations or beliefs are challenged. It is not necessarily a defense mechanism, but rather a physical reaction that we perform unconsciously. The gesture can help us process the information and make sense of the situation. It may also be a way to cope with the emotional impact of the surprise by providing a physical outlet for the intensity of our feelings.
The Obama Student Loan Repayment Program	If you pay your student loans on time, for ten years (not twenty), the remainder will be forgiven up to $45,000. The amount you pay for those 120 months is capped at 10% of your income. This only includes Perkins and Stafford loans, not private loans (like from a bank or where you have to get a credit check). Edit: It is ten years if you work in public service. My apologies.	The Obama Student Loan Repayment Program is also known as the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) program. This program was launched in 2012 to help federal student loan borrowers manage their debt payments. Under this program, borrowers' monthly loan payments are calculated based on their income, family size, and other factors, so they can pay an affordable amount that is not more than 10% (previously 15%) of their discretionary income. After 20 years of making payments, any remaining loan balance is forgiven (10 years if they work in public service). This program applies to loans that were issued after October 2007 and are eligible for the Direct Loan program.
Why do we already start sweating below 30°C if our body temperature is around 36°C?	Your body temperature (which is closer to 37°C IIRC) is the result of  an equilibrium. The stuff you do to keep alive generates heat.   You also lose heat to the environment. These have to be in a balance to maintain a constant body temperature. The difference between your internal temperature and the external air temperature is vital in determining how fast heat is lost. When the external temperature is too close to your internal temperature, you can't lose heat fast enough without sweating. If you didn't start sweating, the very act of staying alive would raise your temperature and kill you. Hence your body has to sweat well before the air temperature reaches 37°C Also, when it gets too cold, you stop sweating, but your body also has to do extra things to keep your heat generation higher than the rate you lose heat.   That is why you shiver.	We start sweating below 30°C as a mechanism of our body to regulate our body temperature to around 36°C. When the temperature around us increases, our body produces sweat, which evaporates and cools down our skin. As a result, our body temperature is regulated and maintained at the optimal range for our body to function properly. Sweat production is also influenced by other factors such as humidity, physical activity, and clothing, among others.
Why do computers take so long to boot up?	It can be a multitude of things such as slow/outdated hardware to a clunky clogged up computer. I think a lot of times it also has to do with a mixture of your hardware/operating system/and how many processes begin upon boot up. If you have old, even new, hardware and your computer has a million different processes it is trying to load upon boot up it's going to take a while.	Computers may take a while to boot up for several reasons, including hardware specifications, the number and complexity of installed software and startup programs, and the need to check system files and perform other diagnostic and maintenance tasks. Additionally, some modern computers are designed to optimize power usage and security, which may result in longer startup times.
When is the census data used by states to draw Congressional district maps?	The exact details depend on the state, but they have to do it by the Congressional election that comes in the year ending in 2, which gives them a little under two years.  The Census is released on April 1 of years ending in 0, and the deadline for states to be notified of their number of representatives is the following January 25 (in the year ending in 1).  So they have from then until the following election (early November in the year ending in 2) to complete their redistricting, though they really have a bit less time since people need to know what district they live in somewhat before the election so they can choose who to vote for.	Census data is used by states to draw Congressional district maps every ten years following the decennial census. The data collected during the census provides information on the population and demographic characteristics of the country and is used to determine the number of seats each state will have in the House of Representatives. States use this data to redraw their district boundaries to ensure that each district has a roughly equal population. This process is known as redistricting and is typically done by the state legislature or an independent commission.
Why is maritime piracy still a problem today?	Ships in international water are not allowed to carry firearms due to laws made about arms smuggling.  Weak law enforcement in countries like Somalia made it highly profitable and little chance of getting arrested on land. Especially if your paying off the cops. Recently ships are allowed to hire armed gaurds and also patrols have been stepped up to stop the pirates.	Maritime piracy is still a problem today for several reasons. Firstly, there are certain regions in the world, such as the Gulf of Guinea off the coast of West Africa and the waters off the coast of Somalia, that are particularly vulnerable to piracy due to factors such as political instability, weak governance, and poverty. Secondly, the lucrative nature of the shipping industry means that pirates continue to see it as a profitable activity. Finally, pirates have become increasingly sophisticated and are constantly adapting their tactics to avoid detection and capture. This requires a coordinated effort between governments, navies, and the shipping industry to combat piracy effectively.
Why are Romans and Italians different?	"In Classical Europe, cities were nations.  People's identity, nationality, and loyalty were with their city, and only loosely with larger ethnic and linguistic groupings when attacked from outside the region. So first, the people of Rome were the only Romans.  But then Rome conquered the other cities of Italy, and their cultures gradually fused together, so Italians became Romans even without living in or even liking the City of Rome.  It was simply the capital of  of the civilization they all inhabited. When it grew beyond Italy, ""Roman"" just described a way of life and a political structure.  Eventually, if you were not a slave, lived a certain way, paid homage to the gods of Rome as prescribed in law, and paid taxes in the coin of Caesar, you were Roman.  And then it was so universal that you were Roman anyway, and just a criminal Roman if you didn't do the things prescribed in Roman law. But that fell apart and got mixed with Germanic and other nomadic peoples who migrated into Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, and meanwhile Italy returned to being a bunch of autonomous cities, so ""Romans"" went back to just meaning people of the city of Rome."	The Romans were an ancient civilization that lived in the city of Rome, while Italians are individuals who are citizens of Italy, a country that has evolved over time from various ancient civilizations including the Romans. Therefore, while the Romans were a specific group of people who lived in a particular city in ancient times, Italians are a diverse group of people who live in a modern country with a rich history that includes the contributions of the Romans.
What incentive does a college level professor have to utilizing the online services of publishing companies like Pearson?	"It's more the second, though I think you've overstated it, at least in most cases. We don't get paid anything by Pearson, but everything they supply is free to us but not (of course) to you. Those sites do provide a lot of content and ""assessment"" tools. There's enough stuff there that one can cobble together a passable class with just what's provided, which definitely makes things easier, especially when it's something the instructor hasn't taught before. And there's still lots more left to do besides ""simple administrative tasks."" But it is quite handy to have grades entered automatically. That said, the teachers I know well and respect don't use them that much. Most classes have Canvas as a ""class management system,"" which will do most of the same things, if the instructor provides the content. I've been able to migrate my classes off of the online sites, but producing the necessary content myself has been a huge undertaking—one I didn't get a dime for. I am a big fan (and proponent) of open educational resources and trying to reduce student cost. I've saved my students many thousands of dollars by getting off of the Pearson ""Mastering"" sites and McGraw-Hill ""Connect.""  But teaching is a hell of a lot more work than you seem to think it is, and many instructors find themselves suddenly having to teach a class they have never taught before and for which they have no materials prepared. These types of resources can be a godsend for them. Been there, done that."	There are several incentives for a college-level professor to use the online services of publishing companies like Pearson. These companies provide access to a wide range of educational resources, including textbooks, course materials, and assessment tools. One significant incentive is the convenience that comes with having all of these resources available in one place. Professors can easily find and assign readings, quizzes, and other assignments to their students using the platform. Additionally, many of these services offer customizable content and assessments, allowing professors to tailor their materials to the specific needs of their class. Finally, publishing companies often provide training and support to help professors maximize the use of their platforms, further incentivizing them to utilize these tools.
Why, instead of IPv6, dit the wise men of the Internet not add an octect in front.	Why add just one octet when you could quadruple the number of octets so there's no conceivable way you could ever run out? That's part of what ip6 is. Even if you added just one octet you'd still have to update lots of Internet hardware and software, just as they have to do to roll out ip6. So you might as well make it more future proof.	Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) was developed as a solution to address the depletion of IPv4 addresses, which are only four octets in length. Adding an extra octet in front would not have solved the problem of address exhaustion since it would only provide an additional 8 bits of addressing space, which would still be insufficient for the growing number of devices and users on the internet. IPv6, on the other hand, uses 128-bit addresses, providing more than enough address space for future growth and expansion of the internet.
Why do other animals have multiple species and breeds, but humans are all just humans?	A species becomes another species when it no longer breeds successfully with the other species. This may happen prior to fertilization or post fertilization. Humans can all successfully produce young with each other, therefore one species.  Breeds, like with dogs, are from humans forcing gene selection. Humans have selected dog matches that particular trait they are looking for (stronger, faster, chocolate, white) In nature dogs wouldn’t select a mate because it looks similar to it. So breeds are a human made thing that do not occur naturally.	This is because humans have a relatively recent common ancestry and have not had enough time to diverge into separate species like other animals. Additionally, humans have intentionally bred for certain traits in their domesticated animals, leading to the creation of different breeds, while humans have not engaged in such deliberate selective breeding with their own species.
How do rich and famous people prevent kidnappings of family members?	my country have death penalty for kidnappers. even if you surrender before the police find you, you still get a life long sentence with canning.  the most important thing is, everything is traceable here so you really can't hide. because of that, no one actually does that anymore. even if it happen, it's like once in a 50 year incident. welcome to Singapore where citizen behave.	Rich and famous people often hire security teams to protect their family members and themselves from potential threats, including kidnapping. This can involve measures such as background checks on employees and contractors, strict access control to their homes and workplaces, and advanced surveillance technology. They may also avoid sharing too much information about their whereabouts and daily routines on social media or in the public domain. In some cases, they may even have safe rooms or panic rooms in their homes and offices to protect themselves and their loved ones in case of a kidnapping or other emergency situation.
what wastes more energy turning you air conditioner on/off or letting it run?	I would say it depends on too many things to simplify it. Say it's your house and it has single pain windows and no insulation, then the AC is battling agains heat gains all day to keep the place cool so it's very inefficient. But if your house is insulated like a cooler, good windows, doors sealed, walls with insulation, shades to reduce solar gains, then the AC will not have to work as hard at maintaining the temperature. Look at your fridge, the cooling is normally triggered everyone you open the door, but less often if you don't open the door as you lose the cold (gain heat) every time you open the door.	It ultimately depends on how long you plan on leaving your air conditioner on or off. If you're leaving your home for an extended period of time, turning off your air conditioner can save energy. However, if you're just leaving the house for a short amount of time, it's usually more energy-efficient to leave your air conditioner running, as it takes more energy to turn it off and on again compared to just letting it run. Additionally, if your air conditioner is not regularly maintained and serviced, it may use more energy when it's running and waste more energy overall. It's important to consider factors like your usage patterns, climate, and system efficiency when deciding how to best conserve energy with your air conditioner.
How would a quantum computer be programmed?	In an attempt to explain like you're actually 5: Imagine a set of 20 switches. An electrical signal only makes it to the last switch if all of the switches are correctly set to 'a' or 'b,' but we have no way to figure out the answer without manually testing every combination.  From what I understand, a quantum computer uses a particles superposition which allows it to test every switch as being simultaneously a AND b, essentially enabling the computer to evaluate all possible paths at once, and then pick out the only correct answer from the bunch.  As far as programming that computer goes... I have no idea. I imagine an entirely new language and compiler will have to be developed.  Edit: it has been a while, but last I heard the most complex calculation done by a quantum computer was something like 4x4=16, so a true, thorough answer may not yet be known. Edit2: disregard, McVomit has the best link.	Quantum computers can be programmed using specialized programming languages such as Qiskit, Cirq, and Quil. These languages are designed to express quantum algorithms and circuits in a way that can be executed on a quantum computer. Programming a quantum computer involves defining quantum circuits that encode an input state, apply quantum gates to manipulate the state, and then measure the output state to obtain a result. The process of programming a quantum computer requires a deep understanding of quantum mechanics and quantum computing principles.
Why should I worry about companies (such as FB and Google) data-mining my Internet profiles?	While a lot of people are a bit weirded out by unknown parties looking over their shoulders, the main point is that the data being used likely is being used in ways you don't recognize. It can also be used in ways we haven't seen yet, so far as we know. For example you don't think you see targeted ads because you use an ad blocker. But are you **sure** you aren't seeing ads? For example when you open YouTube the videos you see suggested are based on your collected data and can subtly impact your behavior by adjusting the media you are exposed to. They might as well be ads. When you search for something on Google do you think the results are the same for everyone? Of course not! They are customized for your particular profile and they can steer you towards certain things; it might be that they predict you are looking to buy a table saw and prefer to steer you toward pages that include a brand that is paying Google for advertising. Or maybe they skew your search results toward pages that include positive language regarding a political candidate that would benefit the company. Getting money from you by predicting your desires is perhaps the most benevolent use of the data collected. They could make you angry about certain issues, or complacent, or ignorant, or change your mind without you even knowing. When political races hinge on a percentage point or two even a subtle tweak to the national consciousness can make all the difference, so even if you are convinced it could never happen to you because you are special and immune to manipulation, it can work on some people. Enough to make a difference.	You should be aware of companies data-mining your Internet profiles because it can have privacy implications. They may collect a lot of personal information about you, such as your interests, habits, and personal details, and use this data for targeted advertising or even sell it to third-party companies. This can lead to unwanted spam emails, phone calls, or even identity theft. Additionally, over time, the data they collect about you can build a detailed profile of your behavior and preferences, which can be used to manipulate your actions or opinions. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor your online activity and the information you disclose to avoid unwanted consequences.
How is it that pigs can grow from being a tiny piglet to a mature 250-300 pig in 6 months, but it takes some animals (like humans) so much longer to achieve that much growth?	Because we are born before our heads get too big to come out of a woman's pelvis. We are MUCH weaker than other mammals at birth. Many take minutes, hours or days to walk. We take a year or more.  This is caused by two parts of our evolution. 1, we have large brains and need a large head to accommodate them. That means that we need to be born before our heads get very big.  Two, being upright instead of on all fours limits how much the pelvis can spread. So a woman's pelvis is narrower than typical for a mammal and a baby's head is larger than normal for a mammal. This all results in babies needing to be born waaaaay before most mammals do.	Pigs are able to grow rapidly due to their efficient digestive system and high metabolism, which allows them to convert food into muscle and fat quickly. Additionally, pigs have been selectively bred by humans for thousands of years to maximize their growth potential. In contrast, humans have a longer growth period because our bodies require more time to develop specialized organs and systems, such as our brain and nervous system. Additionally, humans have a longer lifespan and need to maintain our growth and development throughout our entire lives.
If android has such a dominant share of the smart phone market, why do so many developers release apps for iOS first?	Because IOS is easier to make apps for. If you make your app work on IOS, it pretty much works exactly the same on every model of iPhone. And there are only about 8 or 9 of those total.  To make an app work for the Android operating system, you have to make sure it works on a huge variety of phone types. Different screen sizes. Different button combinations. Different operating versions. Nobody wants to release an app on the Play store that works on a certain type of Droid but then messes up when downloaded on another type.	The reasons why some developers choose to release apps for iOS first are varied, but some possible explanations may include: 1. iOS users are known to be more likely to spend money on apps and in-app purchases, making it a more lucrative market for developers. 2. iOS has historically had a more consistent and standardized platform with fewer hardware and software variations to account for, making it easier for developers to create and update apps. 3. iOS users are often early adopters and trendsetters, making it a good market for developers to gain traction and visibility for their apps. 4. iOS has a reputation for being more secure and less prone to malware and hacking, making it a safer platform for certain types of apps. However, it's worth noting that many developers still prioritize Android and release apps for that platform first or simultaneously with iOS, and the gap between the two platforms in terms of app availability and quality has significantly narrowed in recent years.
Why do the Air Force One pilots get switched with every president?	When I was 6 or so, I met the Air Force One pilot for George W Bush. The pilot gave me a box of peanut M & Ms with the American seal on it and the president's personal signature on it in sharpie, next to the printed signature. I ripped it open, ate it and threw it away. Apparently stuff with his actual signature is worth around $300 now. Drat.	The pilots who fly Air Force One are part of the Presidential Airlift Group, which is a special unit of the United States Air Force. They are highly trained professionals who specialize in flying the presidential aircraft. The pilots are typically rotated every few years, regardless of who the current president is, to ensure that they have the most up-to-date training and experience. Additionally, some presidents may have personal preferences for certain pilots or crew members, so rotations allow for flexibility in accommodating those requests.
"What is it exactly that is keeping us from ""curing"" cancer and other currently incurable illnesses?"	"""Cancer"" isn't one specific illness.  Instead, it refers to a group of illnesses caused by abnormal cell growth.  There are a HUGE number of different cell types in the body, all of which have their own specific machinery, which allows them to do their job.  So for example, an abnormal white blood cell will be completely different than an abnormal liver cell.  To make things more complicated, there are many different causes for a cell to turn cancerous.  In order to ""cure""  ""cancer"" we would need to have every bit of cellular machinery of every different type of cell figured out.  We would then need to have different medications that target each of these specific cells ideally without causing too much collateral damage."	Cancer and other currently incurable illnesses are complex diseases that involve various factors such as genetic mutations, changes in the immune system, and environmental factors. Finding a cure for these diseases requires research and understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved, which can be a long and challenging process. Additionally, developing and testing new treatments require extensive clinical trials and significant funding. Therefore, while progress is being made in understanding and treating these diseases, it can take time to find a definitive cure.
How did orange juice become the defacto standard for fruit juices?	"If any juice is going to be a ""standard"", wouldn't it be apple juice? That said, I don't think there is a ""defacto standard for fruit juices"".  Some are more popular in one place, others more popular in other places, depending on price and availability and local custom.  Grape juice is very cheap, so is widely used as a sweetening agent, mixed in with other juices, and used to pack canned fruit. As for orange juice... when I was a kid, that was the most expensive juice on the supermarket shelf.  My mother called it ""Liquid Gold"" and would allow me just one small cup of it, every morning with my breakfast."	Orange juice became the de facto standard for fruit juices largely due to its popularity and availability. Oranges are an abundant fruit in many countries, and their juice has been marketed heavily for its health benefits and refreshing taste. Additionally, the invention of pasteurization made it possible to preserve orange juice for longer periods of time, making it more widely available and convenient for consumers. Other fruits juices have gained popularity over the years, but orange juice remains a classic favorite.
Please explain how Al Sharpton owes 19 million in back taxes and isn't in jail	1) He doesn't owe 19 million in back taxes. 2) Typically, people are arrested for tax *evasion*. By all accounts the IRS is very good at providing payment arrangements to those who owe back taxes. After all, their primary goal is to collect their money and it's hard for inmates to pay off their debts.	It is important to clarify that Al Sharpton does not currently owe 19 million dollars in back taxes. He did, however, face significant tax issues in the past. In the 1990s, Al Sharpton's organization, the National Action Network, was found to have significant tax deficiencies. This resulted in years of unpaid taxes and significant penalties accruing against Sharpton and his organization. However, Sharpton and his team worked to address the issue with the IRS, setting up payment plans and negotiating the debt down over several years. As of today, any outstanding taxes or penalties from this issue have been resolved. It is incorrect to suggest that Sharpton owes 19 million dollars in back taxes currently, and it is important to understand that the situation in the 1990s is much more complex than a simple case of unpaid taxes.
"Why are nocturnal and deep-ocean creatures so consistently ""weird"" looking to us humans, when compared to other creatures?"	Diurnal (Daytime) animals need to look a certain way for many different reasons e.g. camouflage, courtship rituals. This places a selective evolutionary pressure on the population to maintain certain looks or features. Nocturnal and deep-ocean creatures cannot see each other (much) and therefore looks are almost entirely unimportant. This means that they are more influenced by other factors (such as having better hearing), whilst things like sight and looks take a back seat. This leads to random changes in looks being preserved because there is no selective pressure against them. If the whole world was blind, the average person would become uglier because the attractive ones no longer have an evolutionary advantage. Instead, the ones with other favourable traits would come through, regardless of their attractiveenss. As such, over time the population's looks become irrelevant and morph into a random mix of ugly/beautiful. This population would then look pretty hideous to another population which can see and is subject to a selective pressure based on appearance because they're used to seeing the most attractive variants of their species be the most successful ones.	"Nocturnal and deep-ocean creatures have adapted unique physical characteristics and behaviors to survive in their respective environments, which can appear unusual or strange to us humans. The deep ocean is a dark and extreme environment with high pressure and minimal light, which has led to the evolution of creatures with bioluminescence, elongated and transparent bodies, and other unique adaptations. Similarly, nocturnal creatures have adapted to hunt and navigate in the dark with keen senses and physical features like large eyes, sensitive ears, and specialized limbs or appendages. These adaptations may seem ""weird"" to us because they are so different from the creatures we are familiar with in our own environments."
Is it possible to take down all DNS servers? What would happen to the Internet?	"To take down the DNS you'd probably want to focus on disrupting the DNS root servers. These servers basically keep track of Top Level Domain name servers which keep track of .com/.org/.biz/.mil/.gov/.edu/ etc TLDs. There have been many such attacks with varying degrees of success but so far no one has taken the entire DNS down for any meaningful amount of time. A fellow by the name of Dan Kaminsky uncovered a (if exploited) fatal security exploit in 2008 but luckily for everyone he chose to notify the authorities instead of use the exploit for malicious purposes. For his efforts he was given one of the 14 ""keys"" to the DNS system. In the event of a failure 7 of the 14 keyholders must meet at a secret pre-determined place in order to reboot the DNS. The technique Dan Kaminsky discovered exploited a flaw in the way DNS servers decide which servers they can trust and which ones they can't. Basically he found he could trick a DNS server into believing that he was also a ""trustable"" DNS server and that domain name lookup tables he provided were therefore also legit. Of course if you can feed incorrect information to DNS server which it will blindly accept you can destroy its lookup tables in what is known as cache poisoning. If those tables become corrupted the server becomes effectively useless at providing correct information and its tables will need to be rebuilt. Other methods such as DDoS are much more crude and work by simply overwhelming the system with bogus requests so that it doesn't have time to respond to legitimate requests, effectively grinding everything to a halt. These kinds of attacks are usually limited to smaller parts of the DNS because they simply don;t have the ""firepower' to be able to knock out the whole thing. Additionally, the DNS is designed in such a way that the attack would have to completely saturate the system for more that 24 hours before it could actually start to mess things up. Usually in that amount of time you can either deploy some counter measures or find other ways to filter out the malicious traffic. Recently efforts have been made to make the DNS much more distributed and therefore much harder to completely take offline. There have been many security enhancements but there will almost definitely always been some means of exploiting other existing vulnerabilities if you have the time and resources to do so. It's a very very very robust and secure system but like any computer system, it is not 100% bulletproof."	It is not possible to take down all DNS servers as they are distributed all over the world. However, taking down a significant number of them could cause network disruptions and make it difficult or impossible for users to access websites or services using domain names. If all DNS servers were to be taken down, the internet would still function, but users would need to access websites and services using IP addresses rather than domain names, which would make the internet much more difficult to use for the average person.
Why does it take longer to cook 2 burritos in the oven than it takes to cook 1? How does heat distribution work?	This is usually true in a microwave oven. The machine converts electricity into microwave energy, which is absorbed by the food and turns into heat. The more food you're heating, the more heat energy it takes to reach a certain temperature. It's actually true in a conventional oven too, but conventional ovens waste so much energy that the effect is harder to notice.	It takes longer to cook two burritos in the oven than one because the heat distribution is not the same for each burrito. The oven needs to transfer heat to each burrito, and when there are two, the heat needs to be divided in the oven to accommodate two burritos. This means that each burrito will receive slightly less heat than if it were cooked alone, and therefore will need more time to cook through fully. Heat distribution works by the oven using convection currents to circulate hot air throughout the oven cavity. The hot air rises and the cooler air sinks, creating a constant flow of heat that cooks food evenly. However, when cooking multiple items at once, the heat needs to be divided and may result in longer cooking times.
How are prescription drug makes able to sell drugs at such absurd markups, and is there anything consumers can do to change it?	Generally speaking, it costs a lot to bring a drug to market. R & D costs are high, and then the FDA puts it through a lengthy and costly evaluation process. So while it may be true that it is $1 worth of medicine, that ignores millions of dollars that went into the development that need to be recouped to turn a profit on the drug. The company gets a patent on the drug for a time that helps with that, but when it becomes generic the price will drop a good bit.  Government intervention of various types could bring prices down, but too much intervention could end up disincentivizing R & D.	Pharmaceutical manufacturers set prices for prescription drugs based on a number of factors, including research and development costs, production costs, marketing expenses, and potential profits. These markups can often be very high, which can make prescription drugs expensive for consumers. Consumers can try to lower their prescription drug costs by: 1. Comparing prices at different pharmacies. 2. Asking their doctor about lower-cost alternative drugs. 3. Using coupons or discount programs. 4. Checking if they are eligible for assistance programs such as Medicaid or Medicare. Advocating for changes in drug pricing policies and regulations can also help address the issue of high drug costs. This includes lobbying for more transparency in drug pricing, drug price negotiation by the government on behalf of consumers, and increasing competition in the pharmaceutical market.
why foods taste so different when hot vs cold?	"I have a degree in food science and this was a very interesting topic to me. I'll try to answer to the best of my ability while keeping it simple.  The first reason relates to how you actually taste things. The way we perceive taste is actually a combination of our taste buds and our nose working. Taste buds send a signal to the brain when food touches them. But your nose is also very important. You have probably experienced the decrease in taste perception when you have a cold or stuffy nose. There is a passageway in the back of your throat called the retronasal route that leads into your nose. So when the food hits this spot, you essentially ""smell"" it from inside your mouth, and this adds another layer to flavor perception. Different food flavors volatilize, or become airborne (smellable) at different temperature. You will notice this when you cook. As you pull the ingredients out of the fridge they might have some odor to them, but once they are all in a pot together cooking the smell is amplified and starts to fill the whole house. In the same way, you will essentially ""smell"" hotter food through the retronasal route in your throat more than colder food, because the flavors are more airbourne.  There is also an interesting link between temperature and taste. In studies, people tend to perceive spicy foods as less spicy when they are cold. If you keep your hot sauce in the fridge, you will notice this. This is probably due to the reasons I explained above."	Foods can taste different when hot versus cold because temperature can affect the release of flavor compounds and the perception of texture. Warmer temperatures can enhance the release of aroma compounds, making the food appear more aromatic and flavorful. Hot food can also change the texture of the food, making it more tender or softer. Cold temperatures can dull the flavor of certain foods and make them less aromatic and more bland. Additionally, certain foods may have a different mouthfeel or texture when cold versus hot, which can also impact their perceived taste.
How can someone deny being a feminist whilst also supporting equal treatment of men and women?	Whenever you hear the phrase 'equal treatment', you need to ask where the line of 'equality' is being drawn. Consider sexual harassment.  Imagine you went out to a frat party and got a little too drunk.  When you wake up, you find yourself stripped down to your skivvies with a dick drawn on your face. If you're a man, this is something you more or less laugh off.  It's your fault you got drunk and put yourself in a position where frat boys could play stupid pranks on you.  No harm, no foul. If you're a woman, you contact the police and look for people to get arrested. If you want men and women to be treated equally in this situation, then you're either imposing men's standards onto women or vice versa - in either case, you're making half the population submit to social conventions that are likely to make them uncomfortable. And that's where the opposition to feminism comes in.  Feminism, as practiced in the modern day, isn't really about 'equal treatment' so much as it is about imposing a feminine ideal of social convention onto men.	Someone may deny being a feminist while also supporting equal treatment of men and women because they may not want to associate with the label or movement of feminism, but still believe in gender equality. They may have personal reasons for not identifying as a feminist, such as disagreeing with certain tactics or beliefs within the movement. However, supporting equal treatment of men and women aligns with the core principles of feminism, even if someone chooses not to call themselves a feminist.
I have a cut on my hand. It's been a few days and there is a scab, and the surrounding skin is warm to the touch and red. What are my cells doing near the cite of the wound to repair the damage?	The cells nearby are dividing faster than usual and using more nutrients from the bloodstream than they usually would.  Nearby blood vessels dilate (open up) to allow more blood to flow into that area to supply these nutrients.  The body might even grow more blood vessels in the area for this purpose.  The higher blood flow can make the skin appear redder and feel warmer.	The warm and red skin around the scab indicates that your body's immune system is responding to the wound. Your immune cells are releasing cytokines and other signaling molecules to recruit more immune cells, white blood cells, and monocytes, that help to remove any remaining debris and begin the process of tissue repair. Fibroblasts, cells that produce collagen, are also attracted to the wound site and begin depositing a matrix that bridges the gap and provides structure for new tissues to form. Finally, new blood vessels are formed, which supply nutrients and oxygen to the healing tissue. All these processes, including immune system activation, fibroblast formation, and new blood vessel formation, work together to repair the damage caused by the cut on your hand.
What is the Glasgow scale and what is its relation/how is it used with dementia, Alzheimer’s, or other degenerative and mental health problems?	The Glasgow Scale is a way to quantify someone's Level of Consciousness and Orientation Three are three categories: * Best eye response * Best verbal response * Best motor response Best eye response is ranged from 1 to 4 where: * 1 = none (patient doesn't open eyes for anything * 2 = to pain (patient only opens eyes to painful stimuli) * 3 = to speech (patient only opens eyes to verbal stimuli) * 4 = spontaneous (patient opens eyes without needing any stimulus) Best verbal response ranges from 1 to 5 where: * 1 = none (patient cannot speak) * 2 = incomprehensible speech (attempts to speak are made but actual words are not understandable) * 3 = inappropriate words (patient can speak more clearly but no sense can be made of them) * 4 = confused (patient makes some sense but doesn't know one or more of the following (who he is, where he is, what day/time it is or what is happening at the moment) * 5 = oriented (patient is fully oriented and has no confusion, speaks clearly and logically) And best motor response ranges from 1 to 6 where: * 1 = none (patient has no motor response to any stimuli) * 2 = extension to pain (painful stimulus causes limb extension * 3 = flexion to pain (painful stimulus causes limb flexion) * 4 = withdraws from pain (pulls limb away from painful stimulus) * 5 = localizes pain (moves hand to source of pain in attempt to remove the pain) * 6 = obeys commands (normal voluntary motor response) So a normal person with nothing wrong with them will have a GCS of 15. Someone who is confused but otherwise normal will have a GCS of 14.  In cases of dementia, Alzheimer's or other mental health problems, the patient may have a GCS baseline less than 15. GCS is helpful in identifying further or acute deterioration of patient's mental status if there is a drop in their score from baseline.	The Glasgow Coma Scale is a standardized assessment tool used to evaluate the level of consciousness and neurological functioning of a patient who has suffered a head injury. While it is not specifically related to dementia, Alzheimer’s, or other degenerative and mental health problems, it can be used in conjunction with neurological and cognitive assessments to help diagnose and monitor these conditions. Patients with advanced dementia or other degenerative or mental health problems may have a low Glasgow Coma Scale score due to neurological impairment or other underlying medical conditions. Regular monitoring of their score can help healthcare providers adjust treatment and care plans accordingly.
Why are people saying the new law in Mississipi promotes bullying?	"I might be mistaken, but it prevents people from acting or refusing to act in a way that would offend their religious beliefs. Correct me if I am wrong, but a doctor could refuse treatment on religious grounds of a patient if the patient happened to be gay. Or a police officer refusing to answer to a 911 call for a similar ""religious"" reason.  It might not extend to service personnel like that, but certainly store owners can refuse service to people who are gay. This is legally protected discrimination, which is why there is outcry about religious bullying.  I keep referencing gay people because they have become the group that is most heavily discriminated against, at least on ""religious"" grounds. But this can equally extend to any reason that can tie into religion. For instance, a person could refuse service to another because they are not the same denomination as them. Or could vandalize their property because that is what their religion tells them to do."	"The new law in Mississippi is known as the ""Mississippi Student Religious Liberties Act,"" and some people argue that it promotes bullying because it allows students to express their religious beliefs in school, even if those beliefs are discriminatory or exclusionary towards other students. Critics argue that this could lead to an increase in religious harassment, bullying, and intimidation towards minority groups, such as LGBTQIA+ students. Others argue that the law is necessary to protect students' religious freedom and prevent discrimination against their beliefs."
"Why were ""blueprints"" originally made in blue?"	"Blueprints use the cyanotype process invented by the astronomer John Herschel in 1842. The paper is coated with a solution of two soluble iron salts(iron ammonium citrate and potassium ferricyanide). The two iron salts do not react with each other in the dark, but when they are exposed to ultraviolet light the iron ammonium citrate becomes an iron(II) salt. The iron(II) ion reacts with the potassium ferricyanide in the presence of the ammonia ""developer"" to form an insoluble blue compound, iron ferrocyanide, also known as Prussian blue."	"Blueprints were originally made in blue because of the process used to create them, called cyanotype. Cyanotype involves coating paper with a mixture of ammonium iron citrate and potassium ferricyanide, which created a light-sensitive surface. When exposed to light, the mixture turned blue (hence the term ""blueprint""). This process was particularly popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries when architectural and engineering drawings were made by hand and reproduction technologies did not exist."
What is the science behind how a boomerang works?	"There are four main points to understand about a boomerang: 1) You throw it vertically, not horizontally.  This will be important later. 2) Airfoils.  Each arm of the boomerang is a little airplane wing, which creates lift as the boomerang spins and flies.  There are left-handed and right-handed boomerangs because of this; if you throw with the wrong hand it will spin ""backwards"" and won't produce lift. 3) Unbalanced lift.  Since the boomerang is moving forward at the same time as it's spinning, the arms aren't moving through the air at the same speed.  For one arm the spin and the forward motion are working together, creating more lift.  For the other arm the spin and the forward motion are fighting each other, meaning less lift.  This means there's more lift on one side of the boomerang than the other, so it will try to tilt to the side. 4) Gyroscopic precession.  Things that are spinning resist being tilted - think of a child's top or someone spinning a basketball on their finger.  It's one of the more ""wtf"" behaviors in basic physics: a spin around one axis and a tilting torque around a second axis combine into a turn about the third axis instead.  So when the boomerang, which is spinning, tries to tilt because of the unbalanced lift, it ends up turning instead.  This is why you have to throw it vertically, not horizontally: it's spinning about the left-right axis, and the unbalanced lift is trying to tilt it about the front-back axis.  So it ends up turning around the up-down axis, which means it turns around and flies back to you.   If you were to throw it horizontally, the axes would be different and it would turn upwards instead, flying up into the air uselessly."	The science behind how a boomerang works is in its shape and the way in which it is thrown. When a boomerang is thrown, the flat wings of the boomerang create lift, similar to an airplane wing, as it spins steadily through the air. As the boomerang rotates, it creates an uneven airflow over the wings which in turn creates lift and causes it to curve back towards the thrower. The boomerang's shape and angle allow it to create lift on both sides, causing it to return to the thrower in a circular and predictable path.
What's the difference between browsing and downloading on the Web? My understanding is that content gets downloaded to your computer in both the cases, so what's the catch here.	Yes, you're downloading pages as you browse. The difference, as far as I know, is: - **Browsing** downloads the page to a temporary location, which will be removed when you delete your browser history or cache. - **Downloading** loads to page or file to a true destination for later, offline use (often the /Downloads folder).	Browsing on the web refers to the act of searching for and viewing web pages or content without necessarily saving them to your computer. This means that the data is loaded from the internet onto your device for temporary access, but is not permanently saved on your computer. On the other hand, downloading involves actively saving specific content, such as a file or image, from the internet onto your device's hard drive or storage space. This means that the data is retrieved from the internet and saved on your computer for future use. The key difference between browsing and downloading is that browsing involves temporary access to content, while downloading involves permanently saving content on your device.
"What goes through the mind of a dog thats just been recently adopted? Does it recognize the new ""leader""?"	Not an expert, just somebody that's almost always had a dog in the house for fifty years. The pack mentality of a dog is never a fixed thing, its always in a state of fluctuation, dogs obey the pack hierarchy, while at the same time always testing the limits and ready to move up as the situation changes... in other words, at any given moment, the dog is always assessing and reassessing the hierarchy situation, ready to take advantage of any weakness in the pack leader(s). Yes, some dogs are permanently resigned to be submissive, always at the bottom of the pack, but not most. Just my opinions/observations.	"When a dog is adopted, their thoughts and emotions can vary depending on their individual personality and experiences. Some dogs may feel anxious, scared, or stressed in their new environment, while others may feel excited and curious. It's important to give a new dog time to adjust and to provide them with plenty of love, patience, and positive reinforcement.  Dogs may not recognize a new owner as a ""leader"" in the traditional sense, but they will learn to associate their owner with positive experiences over time. Consistent training and bonding activities are great ways to build a strong relationship and establish trust between a dog and their owner."
Can someone give a non-conspiracy theory based answer as to why Marijuana is illegal in most of the US?	Quite a bit of time and effort was spent in the first half of the 20th century demonizing its use.  The cultural bias against it was strong for generations, which included religious and moral values (rooted in the temperance movement of the late 1800s/early 1900s).   That value system took hold, and it wasn't until the 1960s that it was questioned on a large scale.  Not a coincidence that we see the legalization movement gaining steam as the pre-60s teen/young adult cohort is dwindling fast.	Marijuana was initially made illegal at the federal level in the United States in 1937 with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act. The act was largely driven by the concerns of social and racial groups, who associated marijuana use with African American and Mexican immigrant communities. Additionally, some political and business interests saw marijuana as a threat to their interests, as it could be used as a substitute for products like paper and textiles. Due to these various factors, marijuana was categorized as a dangerous drug and made illegal at the federal level. However, in recent years, attitudes towards marijuana have shifted, and many states have legalized it for medical or recreational use.
Why did Myspace die when it has such a great idea?	A few things: Customizing the HTML/CSS was actually bad for Myspace. The pages that people created were horrible. Music would start playing, and the pages were just plain ugly. The big thing that killed MySpace was obviously Facebook. Now there was a decent alternative. Facebook advantages: - The pages look better. It's a much cleaner interface, and all the pages were standardized. - There wasn't much ads on Facebook in the beginning. When Facebook started having ads, they were not so large and in your face.  - The spamming of Facebook was not nearly as bad as Myspace - Facebook started adding in a LOT of features that were innovative. The newsfeed, apps such as farmville, and tagging in photos. But basically Myspace died because Facebook is better, and then everyone ended up on Facebook.	There are several reasons why Myspace failed despite its innovative idea. Firstly, the platform was slow to adapt and evolve as newer social media platforms emerged. Secondly, Myspace was plagued with technical issues, spam, and security problems that led to a decline in user trust. Thirdly, the company faced challenges in terms of advertising revenue and monetization strategies, leading to financial difficulties. Lastly, Myspace failed to effectively compete with Facebook, which quickly gained popularity and dominated the social media market.
Why can’t we cut off plastic waste at the source? For example, set up a net or something of the like at those insanely polluted rivers in places like China and India.	Because you still have the problem of how to dispose of that plastic.   That waste isn't ending up in rivers in South East Asia for no reason. Its ending up there because that's how waste is disposed of in those countries by everyone involved - including those countries' governments.  The reason that everyone in those countries is disposing of their waste like that is because properly disposing of it is expensive, whereas dumping it into a river or onto unused land is cheap. So even if you pulled everything out of those rivers, all that would happen is that the trash would go back into their municipal garbage systems, which would then dump the trash right back into the rivers. The only way to solve the problem of plastic waste is for South East Asian countries to require that the waste be properly disposed of in the first place.   Unfortunately, one of the key reasons that South East Asian economies are as competitive as they are is because they don't require waste to be properly disposed of, which substantially reduces the overhead of operating in those countries.  And as of right now, no country in South East Asia appears to be serious about tackling any issue if the only way to do so requires them to make their economy less competitive.	Cutting off plastic waste at the source, such as setting up nets in heavily polluted rivers, is one effective approach to controlling plastic pollution, but it is not always easy to implement. The problem is that plastic waste is not generated by a single entity or country, but rather by a global economy that relies heavily on disposable plastic products. Additionally, plastic waste often goes unregulated and unmonitored, which makes it difficult to control and prevent. However, there are non-profit organizations that are working towards this goal, and governments can also take action by passing legislation or imposing regulations on the production and disposal of plastic products. These efforts, when combined with responsible consumer choices and disposal practices, can help reduce plastic waste and prevent it from reaching our waterways.
Why is it difficult for a camera to produce an image in poor lighting that I can see very clearly?	"Your brain can both remember details of what it saw with better lighting (and add them to what you ""see"" now) and can collect information over a long period of time to make an image (your eyes transmit images pretty constantly so there's lots of data for the brain to do ""noise reduction"").  Putting the camera on a tripod for a long exposure (or stacking 30 images) helps the camera quite a bit to capture better images in low light (at least for stationary subjects).  The camera gets a single exposure and you can look at it closely to spot every error."	It is difficult for a camera to produce a clear image in poor lighting because cameras rely on light to create an image. In low light, there is not enough light for the camera sensor to capture sufficient details. This results in the image appearing dim, blurry, or grainy. Human eyes have a higher sensitivity to light and are able to adjust quickly to changing lighting conditions, allowing us to see objects in low light more clearly than a camera can. Additionally, most cameras rely on automatic settings to adjust for different lighting conditions, which may not always be optimal for producing a clear image.
; Why do people who have arthritis get joint aches before it rains or storms?	It's fun because it's all theory still, but the general idea is that people's tissues flair up when the barometric pressure (weight of the atmosphere around us) drops before bad weather. The high barometric pressure usually pushes on us in nice weather so the tissue can't expand, but in bad weather it drops and the tissues expand to put pressure on the joints, causing aches and pains.	People who have arthritis may experience joint aches before it rains or storms because changes in barometric pressure, temperature, and humidity can affect joint tissues. The low pressure that occurs before a storm can cause tissues to expand, putting pressure on the joints and causing discomfort or pain. Additionally, cold and damp weather can also exacerbate arthritis symptoms.
Why do corporations have to defend their trademarks even if the allegation that a competitor is infringing is extremely weak.	If enough incidences of failure to enforce become known, then when they do go after someone who risks both confusing and/or diluting the trademark, the infringer could defend themselves by citing the common use and claim that it's become a generic term. So part of having and keeping a trademark is a duty to enforce.	Corporations have to defend their trademarks even if the allegation that a competitor is infringing is extremely weak because failing to do so can weaken the validity and enforceability of their trademark. Trademarks are a valuable asset for companies, and they need to protect their brand identity and reputation. If a company allows a potential infringement to go unchallenged, it can create confusion in the market and dilute the uniqueness of their trademark. In addition, if a company is perceived as not defending its trademark, it can weaken their ability to enforce their rights in the future and discourage potential licensing opportunities.
The North American college class numbering system? 101, 209, etc...	"- The first number has to do with the year level. ""100"" classes tend to be for freshmen, ""200"" for sophomores, etc.  - The later numbers are just for organizational purposes, but usually lower digits means classes required for the major while higher numbers are used for elective (which often change by the year).  - Some classes are paired together for a full year of the subject. For example, if you took Calculus I in your freshman fall semester and Calc II in the spring, they would probably be listed as MATH 101 and MATH 102 - You don't have to be in the right grade for the class, but many classes come wit prerequisites (classes you need to have finished beforehand). You can't take Calc II without passing Calc I. Also at my college some classes were reserved for different year groups; for example, Psychology 101 and 201 were both ""Introduction to Psychology,"" but the 101 class was reserved for Freshmen and the 201 class for upperclassmen.  - ""____ 101"" is normally an introductory class and would be the first class a freshman would take on the field. It can also be used as slang for learning the basics of a field."	"The North American college class numbering system typically uses three digits. The first digit represents the level of the course: 1 for introductory level courses, 2 for intermediate, 3 for advanced, and 4 for specialized or upper-level courses. The second digit often represents the department within the college or university, while the third digit represents the specific course within that department. For example, a course numbered ""ENG 101"" would typically be an introductory level course in the English department, while a course numbered ""CHEM 209"" would likely be an intermediate level course in the Chemistry department. However, this system can vary depending on the college or university."
Why was torture such a big thing during the medieval times?	"It wasn't.  No, really, it wasn't.  You're talking about hundreds and hundreds of years of history across an entire continent where written history was inconsistent and not common, so most information was held through oral traditions like storytelling.  What makes for a good story? Gruesome embellishments! Same then as now, actually. You want a kid to learn about pea farming in England? Hard sell. But talk about this *Iron Maiden* lined with spikes, and the kids are lining up! So *any* story of torture was more likely to be told, and re-told, and passed down that stories about how to properly plow fields or how farmers knew when to shear the sheep. Grisly stories of torture come from the Bible, from the Romans and the Greek. You find it in Chinese history, and even the polynesian and micronesian cultures have their gruesome stories.  Because it's *history*, we also like to re-tell those stories to show how ""savage"" and ""primitive"" and ""dark"" those other times or other cultures were, compared to how civilized and enlightened we are now.  TL;DR: torture is big in history books because it gets attention, not because it was that big of a deal."	"Torture was used during medieval times as a means of extracting information or confessions from individuals accused of crimes. The legal system during that time was based on the notion of ""trial by ordeal,"" where individuals were subjected to extreme forms of physical pain or discomfort to determine their guilt or innocence. Torture was also used as a form of punishment for crimes committed. Additionally, the religious beliefs held during the medieval period often supported the idea that inflicting pain on the body was an effective means of purifying the soul and attaining salvation."
"Why are there different types of insect killer products under the same brand? Raid has like 5 different types of product for either ""Wasps  &  Hornets"", ""Roaches"", and ""Ants"". Wouldn't one deadly chemical kill all these the same?"	"And  &  roach, anything meant to be applied around baseboards and such, has a vehicle that is oily and sticky so it will stay in place and not evaporate. The intent is for the product to remain where you put it so the insects will walk through it later. I believe the actual insecticide is also more effective/poisonous, because it is comparatively less likely that a human is going to ingest or breathe it. Flying insect killers tend to be ""aim-able"", their vehicles tend to be something that will evaporate fast, and the insecticide is more likely to be something like a pyrethroid which is not poisonous to humans even if you breathe a fairly big does of it accidentally. It would probably only be effective if it directly touches an insect, then it will evaporate and the active ingredient will quickly go inert. Source: Dad used to work for a huge home/consumer insecticide manufacturer you would recognize."	There are different types of insect killers under the same brand because different insects have different behaviors and responses to certain ingredients. For example, wasps and hornets tend to fly and have nests in high places, so Raid created a spray that can reach them from a distance. Roaches are often found in cracks and crevices, so Raid developed a product that can be applied directly to those areas. Ants follow scent trails, so Raid created a bait station to attract and eliminate entire colonies. While some ingredients may work on multiple types of insects, it's important to use a product specifically designed for the type of pest you are targeting.
"When off, how does your phone ""know"" that you've held the power button long enough so that it should turn on?"	"Its a simple circuit. To break things down, imagine a light switch. there is point A and point B. When the light switch is turned off there is no path for current to flow from point A to point B and therefore no current can make it to the light bulb. When the switch is flipped, the circuit becomes ""closed"" and current can flow. In a phone, we have the same thing, only in addition to there being a ""switch"" (the button being suppressed) in-between A and B there is also what is called a capacitor. What happens when you press the button down is the current flows and instead of making it all the way to B, it starts charging the capacitor. There are a bunch of different equations regarding capacitors and how they respond, but suffice to say that the capacitor charges until it is unable to charge anymore and then the current continues out of the capacitor (because it can't hold anymore, picture a you pouring water into a glass and once the glass is full the water overflows and reaches the table) and onto point B telling the phone to turn on. Now, you may ask, why then when i hold the button for 1 second x 3 it doesn't turn on, but when i hold it once for 3 seconds it does...doesn't the capacitor still get charged? Well the answer is yes, but when you stop charging the capacitor it starts spending its saved energy, but at a lower current level than is what is necessary to activate point B"	"When your phone is turned off and you hold down the power button, it sends a signal to the phone's hardware to start the booting process. There is typically a small button or switch located near the power button known as the ""power button switch"" or ""power button connector."" When you press and hold the power button, this switch is activated and sends a signal to the phone's hardware to power on. The phone's firmware then takes over and begins loading the operating system and other necessary components."
Where do banks keep money in the age of digital currency? Do they have to transfer money out of vaults when I do an ACH transfer?	Banks don't actually have your money anywhere. There isn't a box in the vault that has your money in it, in fact, bank vaults just have the cash on hand that a bank needs (and what has been deposited), as well as safety deposit boxes. Your 'bank account' is just a computer file that says how much money you have in it, and the bank just changes that file whenever you put in money, or take it out.  When you remove money, whether it is online or at the bank machine, that value goes down. If you make an online purchase, the bank makes your account file smaller, and makes the seller's account file bigger. Hope this makes more sense!	Banks do not need to physically transfer money out of vaults when you conduct an ACH transfer since most of the money today is stored digitally. Banks keep the money in their accounts, reserve accounts at the central bank, or invest it in other financial instruments. When you conduct an ACH transfer, the bank simply updates the balance in both your account and the recipient's account. The bank is responsible for ensuring that the correct amount of funds is moved between accounts and that all transactions are settled accurately and securely.
why is it that sometimes when you touch something really cold it feels hot at first and takes a few seconds to register that its cold?	"There are three main categories of receptors in the skin at play here. We have warmth receptors, cold receptors, and nociceptors (pain receptors). Warmth receptors begin firing (meaning sending signals to your brain) around 30 degrees Celsius to about 45 degrees Celsius, at which tissue is destroyed. Cold receptors have a broader, bell-shaped range, firing between 10 degrees and 40 degrees, with the most activity occurring around 24-28 degrees Celsius (below 10 degrees, cold will act as an anesthetic [numbing agent]). Cold receptors also differ from warmth receptors in that they are both tonic (they send signals in a continuous rhythm at a given temperature) and, uniquely, phasic, which enables them to also detect change in temperatures. When a temperature change occurs, signaling activity will quickly rise, before dropping off to its normal activity at the new set temperature. Thus, when there is a sudden change in temperature, the cold receptor will be a little slow to respond, because it will take a little bit of time before demonstrating the correct temperature. If the sudden change is to a really cold temperature, the pain receptors will signal the brain that it hurts, before the cold receptors ""tell"" the brain what the temperature is."	This phenomenon is due to the way our nerve receptors respond to different temperature stimuli. Our skin has two different types of receptors for temperature: cold receptors and hot receptors. When we touch something very cold, the cold receptors in our skin are activated and send signals to the brain indicating a rapid decrease in temperature. However, our brain can interpret this sudden change in temperature as a burning or hot sensation, since the activation of the cold receptors can trigger a sympathetic response in the nervous system. After a few seconds, the brain receives additional information from the cold receptors and reinterprets the sensation as cold, allowing us to properly perceive the temperature of the object.
"I often hear about how teachers hate to ""teach to the test"" - - what is on these tests that is such an awful waste of time?"	Even if everything the tests asks is something a student should know that doesn't mean teaching the test is the best way to teach. If I just teach my students how to answer the specific questions that will show up on the test (Like teaching them just how to find the 0s and focus of a parabola) my goal isn't to actually make them understand how what they're doing works or why they should care, I'm just training them to perform arbitrary tasks so that they can do it again with a test paper later. If I instead aim to make them understand the concept of parabolas and how they're represented mathematically they can answer everything on the test fine, and unlike the other class just taught the test as it is these kids also have the fundamental understanding required to figure out how to answer any question one could make about parabolas.	"The problem with solely ""teaching to the test"" is that it can narrow the focus of learning to just the topics and skills being tested, rather than a broader understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, some critics argue that standardized tests commonly used in schools can be biased, culturally insensitive, and fail to measure real-world skills that students need for success. This can result in students feeling pressure to memorize information rather than genuinely understanding the material, which can lead to gaps in their knowledge and long-term negative impacts on their academic and professional careers."
How do lumens and watts relate in lightbulbs?	They don't relate as well as you'd hope. Back in the days of just incandescent bulbs a 40W bulb gave you 400ish lumens, unfortunately things have changed. The incandescent bulbs you find today are halogen and more efficient so they're only 32W for 400 lumens. With LEDs you only need 5-9W depending on the tech in the bulb Really what your lamp cares about is wattage. A 40W incandescent bulb would give off 39W of heat, and a 60W would give off 59. If you put too big of a bulb in then the lamp would overheat and run the risk of fire. These days bulbs are a lot more efficient. You can put any LED you want in there and it won't overheat. You might blind yourself but it won't overheat	Lumens and watts are both units of measurement related to the brightness of a lightbulb, but they measure different things. Watts measure the amount of energy used by the lightbulb, while lumens measure the amount of visible light the bulb produces. In general, a higher wattage bulb will produce more lumens and therefore be brighter, but with advances in technology, some bulbs use less energy (lower watts) to produce the same amount of lumens as higher wattage bulbs. Therefore, it's important to consider both the lumens and watts when choosing a lightbulb to ensure you get the desired level of brightness without wasting energy.
Why there are a variety of programming languages for different things instead of a master language that combines all their strengths?	und ein master browser!  but no, doesnt really work like that. different languages specify in different areas. a tool for every trade, or you end up with a single massively bloated language that nobody can get his head around, and which isnt quite as efficient as it could be in any way. there's efforts underway to simplify scripting and make it a lot more organic though, I think that's the way to go.	There are a variety of programming languages for different things because each language is designed to solve specific problems and to be suited for specific situations. While it may be possible to develop a master language that combines all the strengths of existing languages, it would be complex and difficult to maintain. Additionally, each programming language has its own ecosystem of tools, libraries, and communities that have evolved to support it. Therefore, it is more practical and efficient to use specific languages for specific tasks, as they are often optimized for those tasks and have extensive support systems in place.
ELI5: How do fruitflies just magically appear? Was my banana already full of them?	Larvae are in the fruit. But, not just in fruit. My son left a turkey and cheese sandwich in the car, under the seat, in a lunch bag, in a sealed ziplock baggy. The lunch bag was under the seat for a couple of weeks, until we noticed a smell... When I opened the lunch bag, the sandwich was covered in maggots.	Fruit flies are attracted to ripe and fermenting fruits and vegetables. Female fruit flies lay their eggs on the surface of these foods. The eggs hatch into larvae (maggots), which feed on the decaying flesh of the fruit/vegetable. As they grow, they pupate and eventually emerge as adult fruit flies. So, when you bring home fruits and vegetables that are already infested with fruit fly eggs, it may seem like they've just magically appeared in your kitchen. It's important to store your fruits and vegetables properly to prevent fruit flies from infesting them.
Why do most video players have a notification when switching to full screen mode to allow or exit full screen mode at the top?	This is a browser feature and is to do with user experience and accessibility. In the event a user is unaware what has happened to their computer the video site informs them of what has happened and let's them take action if it was unintended. Tl:Dr for people who don't know how to get out of full screen mode	Most video players have a notification when switching to full screen mode to allow or exit full screen mode at the top to give the user control over their viewing experience and to reduce confusion. Full screen mode can also be disruptive to the user's workflow, so the notification serves as a reminder that they are in full screen mode and allows them to easily exit if needed. Additionally, some users may have difficulty navigating or understanding the full screen mode without a clear indicator or notification.
Why is one of the most radical muslim countries in the world, Saudi Arabia, also a big US ally and weapons recipient?	One theory I've heard is that there was a deal made between the U.S. and the Saudi regime after the oil crisis of the 1970s. The deal was that the Saudi's would never again with hold oil from US markets, they would sell their oil in US Dollars, and they would keep the price/supply of their oil within a range acceptable to the US. In return the US would build the Saudi's oil infrastructure and help arm it's military to better maintain the superiority of the House of Saud within their Kingdom.	Saudi Arabia and the United States have a long-standing relationship based on mutual economic and strategic interests. The U.S relies on Saudi Arabia for its vast oil reserves, while Saudi Arabia relies on the U.S for military protection and weaponry. Additionally, the alliance has been strengthened by shared opposition to rivals such as Iran. It is worth noting that while Saudi Arabia has a reputation for being a conservative Islamic state, the government has been taking steps in recent years to modernize and liberalize its society and economy.
What exactly is jaywalking? Why exactly is it illegal in certain countries?	J-walking is when you cross a street or road without using the cross-walk or similar.  I assume it's frowned upon because it adds an unnecessary obstacle for drivers, and could result in death or injury. It's not a strict law though, and if the cop is reasonable they'll just tell you not to be dumb. [It's happened to me a few times, but it was late at night, and there weren't any cars on the road I crossed]	Jaywalking is the act of crossing a street outside a designated crosswalk or without waiting for a green light at a traffic signal.  The primary reason jaywalking is illegal in some countries is to promote safety on roads and prevent accidents. Pedestrians who cross streets without following the rules of the road and without taking the necessary precautions pose a risk to themselves and to drivers. In some countries, jaywalking is also seen as a violation of traffic laws and can result in a fine or penalty.
Why isn't education free? Isn't putting your future population in debt detrimental to your economy more so than not having that revenue?	All state services have to be paid for. When you're not paying for them upfront, you're paying for them for everyone in taxes. Many people don't want their taxes to increase to pay for other people's education, or even their own. Some people don't think education is a basic human right, so they're not willing to pay to provide it to other people; some people feel that if you don't have money to pay for education, you don't work hard enough to deserve education. Some people don't like the idea of having the government decide on the curriculum for schools, in particular the requirements for age-appropriate sex education that some states have. Some people believe that privately owned for-profit institutions will provide better services than government-owned institutions. All in all, because of these ideas, some people get upset when the government wants to put more money into education, and they oppose it.	There are various reasons why education is not free in most countries, including issues related to funding and budget constraints, political priorities and perspectives on the role of government in supporting education, and the financial sustainability of educational institutions. While it is true that student debt can be detrimental to individual financial well-being and can limit access to education for certain groups, there is also a need to balance the benefits of investing in education with the costs of doing so. Some countries have implemented various measures, such as income-dependent repayment plans or tuition-free policies for certain types of education, to mitigate the negative impact of student debt. Ultimately, the decision regarding the extent and nature of government support for education is a complex one that involves trade-offs and varying perspectives on the role of education in society and the economy.
How are we able to see details of far-away galaxies when we are collecting photons from only a few individual stars?	The way I see it, each pixel maps to the combined colour of 1x10^9/6.84 x 10^5 = 1461 stars (give or take depending on density). In essence, you are just taking a much bigger picture and downsizing it. Sure, there's information lost, but its lost when they combined, not because they overlap. Each pixel you see is essentially the average colour of a particularly sized region of space.	We are able to see details of far-away galaxies through a process called spectroscopy. Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between light and matter. Scientists use the light from individual stars in a distant galaxy to analyze the chemical composition of the galaxy. By studying the light emitted from various stars in the galaxy, scientists can determine the temperature, distance, and speed of the stars. Using this information, they can then create a picture of the galaxy and its structure. Additionally, telescopes are now able to collect and combine light from multiple stars, allowing for better resolution and detail in these faraway galaxies.
Why does plastic take so long to decompose?	Plastics are polymers, which is a fancy word for a long chain made of the same piece stuck to identical pieces like legos. For this explanation let's imagine the typical 4x2 lego brick.  Most naturally occurring polymers are like lego bricks with only the ends attached to one another. you can make a long line of them but they're fairly weakly connected. Microbes and other decomposers are good at taking chains like this apart because weakly connected chains are what they're used to. Plastics are polymers that happen if you stick all eight studs of the brick to the next one in the chain. The connections are much stronger, and decomposers don't know how to handle them as well. Things like Sunlight and waves can eventually snap the lego bricks into groups of two or three, but have a very hard time breaking them back down to individual pieces that can be used by living things again	Plastic takes a long time to decompose because it is not biodegradable. This means that it does not break down easily when exposed to natural elements and microorganisms, unlike materials such as wood or paper. Most plastics also contain chemicals that make them resistant to breaking down, such as polymers and synthetic additives. Instead of decomposing, plastic typically breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces over time through processes such as photodegradation, which is when the sun's UV rays break down plastic into smaller fragments. These small plastic particles, known as microplastics, can persist in the environment for centuries and pose a threat to wildlife and ecosystems.
How can Anonymous prove that the names of the senators and mayors released are actually a part of the KKK?	"They could presumably release documentation- IE, actual records of dues paying members.  Or personal cellphone/Email records.  Presumably, a senator, if they were in the KKK, wouldn't have the Kleagle calling their public line.   Simply saying ""We hacked the KKK and found these names and e-mails"" means very little. The KKK is a very small set of groups, so they're always trying to make themselves look bigger.  It's also possible that they were, you know- emailing these people, or were contacted by robocalls.  So far, I've seen no indication of what context these names were found in-a list of names and numbers on the KKK server means very little. Not to mention that ultimately, you're placing your faith in the KKK's documentation practices.  Frankly, for any high public official to be in with the KKK seems- mondo weird.  Not in a ""I can't believe ANY politician is that racist!"" way, but in a ""I can't believe any politician is that bad at politics"" way.   Robert Byrd was with the KKK in his youth (and to his credit, owned it, repudiated it publicly, and worked on civil rights stuff his whole career- don't like the man much, but credit where it's due).  But at that time, the KKK had real political power a lot of places- doesn't mean they were NICE, but it made political sense to get cozy with them.  Now- they've got like 400, 500 members in a state. Even including family and sympathizers, that's very, very, very few votes, in exchange for the risk of immediate political suicide.  And the Klan is more or less collapsed- indications are that the only reason many groups survive is the regular dues paid by....FBI/LEO infiltrators.  I'm not saying that hate groups don't exist, or aren't a problem- but given what we know about the KKK and politicians, you'd need to see like, some canceled checks for dues, or direct personal data before you consider that someone is a member."	Anonymous would need to provide evidence linking the individuals whose names were released to the Ku Klux Klan, such as documented membership or affiliation. Without concrete evidence, the claims would be considered hearsay and may not hold up in a court of law. It's important to remember that making unsubstantiated accusations can damage innocent people's reputations and should only be done with thorough research and proof.
How do people justify not making police have cameras?	Expense and privacy concerns. If a police officer has a camera on him at all times he's basically a walking CCTV camera and so that brings up all sorts of privacy issues. People walking by that he doesn't have reasonable suspicion to stop and ask for ID could still be IDed by a facial recognition system looking at that video feed.  I still lean towards requiring them, but the privacy issues should be hashed out first. Is this footage going to be public? Available to the police? Only available to internal affairs? Totally secret and only opened at a judge's order?	Some people may argue that requiring police officers to wear cameras is an invasion of privacy or an unnecessary expense for police departments. Others may argue that the cameras can be unreliable or easily manipulated, and therefore not an effective tool for accountability. Additionally, there may be concerns about the legality and ethics of recording interactions with citizens without their knowledge or consent.
"How can so many stereotypical anti-government/institution/""Man"" teens generally identify as liberal? Wouldn't libertarian make more sense to them?"	"Even some anarchists like Noam Chomsky support liberal ""big-government"" because they believe that the government is really the peoples best chance to protect their interests against powerful institutions like corporations.  The thinking goes that if you have less/weaker central government then the corporations will just take more power for themselves and the people will have less say in the public sphere since they can't elect the CEO or board members of a company."	There could be a few reasons for this. Firstly, being anti-government or anti-establishment does not necessarily mean that someone is inherently libertarian. While libertarians are also often skeptical of government power, they have a specific set of principles and beliefs about individual liberty and limited government that may not align with those of these teens. Additionally, for some teens, identifying as liberal may be a way to rebel against their parents or other authority figures who are conservative or right-leaning. Finally, some teens may be drawn to liberal ideas and policies such as social justice and environmentalism, which align with their values and beliefs about the world.
What executive orders issued by the US president are, and what they can and can't do.	The president is the head of the executive branch of government (all the agencies that actually do stuff). Executive orders are like the CEO telling a business to do something.  An executive order shouldn't countermand something that Congress has ordered and can't shift money/budget around outside the limits set by Congress. It shouldn't order people to do anything illegal or unconstitutional.	Executive orders are directives or orders issued by the US president that have the force of law. These orders are based on the president's inherent authority under the Constitution to manage the affairs of the executive branch and carry out the duties and responsibilities of the presidency. Executive orders can be used to: 1. Implement existing laws 2. Set policy and establish priorities for executive branch agencies 3. Create new regulations and programs 4. Respond to emergencies and national security threats 5. Change the structure and organization of executive branch agencies However, executive orders cannot: 1. Override existing laws passed by Congress 2. Make new laws or ignore existing laws 3. Change the Constitution 4. Take away the authority of other branches of government Executive orders are subject to judicial review and can be challenged in court if they exceed the president's authority or violate other constitutional provisions or civil rights protections.
Why is an uneven object, such as a framed picture on the wall, unsettling to humans?	"The easiest way to explain it, mainly from personal experience, would be that humans love patterns and being able to predict things. When people look at a bunch of random numbers and see a ""pattern"" it is because they want to see them and are trained to see them from birth. When you see something that is unsettling it is because there is something that is no longer following a pattern. That pattern is that the lines of the picture are not parallel or perpendicular toward the lines of the wall/building (whatever it should be lined up with). This is why people that have a painting or picture in a hallway with walls that are showing signs of aging and do not look parallel by themselves have an issue with putting things on the walls, no matter how you look at it, it won't line up with something"	Uneven objects can be unsettling to humans because our brains naturally seek out balance and symmetry in our environment. When an object is uneven, it creates a sense of visual tension that can be uncomfortable for some people. Additionally, uneven objects may appear unstable or potentially hazardous, which can also contribute to feelings of unease.
How is the stock market not a pyramid scheme?	>  don't pay a dime in dividends. So what? The company is still valuable, and in the event it is sold off the shareholders would get cash value. In the meantime it is an asset; not a soluble one without the stock market, but still an asset.  >  They took the initial investor's money, and gave nothing back. They gave a share of ownership which is what they paid for. Just because that doesn't instantly turn into cash isn't their fault.  >  The initial investor probably sold his share at a higher value than they bought it, and so on down the line, but that's pretty much like a pyramid scheme, making a buck off the next schmuck to get in on it. Except in this case they are transferring ownership of something with real increasing value, meaning it isn't like a pyramid scheme at all. If you buy a house, make improvements and sell it at a higher price, you aren't running a scam, you are adding value. You need to look harder at what a pyramid scheme actually is.  >  I understand that people buy stocks in the hope of seeing the value go up (why would it go up if it's not paying dividends?) Because it represents ownership of something more valuable.  Imagine you own a field. You wait a while and trees grow on said field. That field is now more valuable because you have the field plus lumber that could be sold. If you owned only a fraction of that field your share would be more valuable than before even if there are no plans to harvest the lumber. It still has that value.  >  but this is in effect a side-market which seems to have almost eclipsed the original purpose Not at all, it is central to the concept! Imagine I am starting a candy shop. I need to buy equipment and supplies, and after my first shop takes off I want to turn the profits toward making more shops. I need money though, so I want to attract investors. But if they decide to invest $100,000 in my store, what happens if they want to get their money back in a few years to do other stuff? I am still working on my shops, I can't just liquidate $100k out of the blue! Having a stock market allows their shares to be sold to someone else at recognition of their increased value. Maybe the business grew and so their share is worth $130,000 now; they sell without my shop and business being bothered. And people are willing to buy because they are confident they can sell it later, even though I never plan to offer dividends. Dividends aren't the point, the increasing value is the goal.	The stock market is not a pyramid scheme because it involves the buying and selling of ownership shares in legitimate businesses. Investors purchase shares in companies that they believe will increase in value and earn profits, rather than simply recruiting others to join and invest in a false promise of high returns. Additionally, the stock market operates under strict regulations and oversight to prevent fraud and ensure fair trading practices.
What exactly creatine does and why it's different from anabolic steroids.	Creatine is a natural occurring substance in most mammals that helps the body supply energy (ATP) to muscles. It is something we mainly process from eating protein heavy diets. Anabolic steroids are inhibitors and prohibitors of certain hormones your body produces, specifically testosterone.  The difference between the two is that creatine is mainly part of our diet, when we eat meat. Too much creatine maybe bad for your health, but recent studies kinda refutes all the worries of kidney and liver damage (but it may make things worse if you already have kidney or liver damage/disease).  Our body naturally removes creatine if we don't use it. Steroid as stated before are alternating your hormonal balances which is kinda like the software code for the body, over usage of steroids can have very negative health aspects.	Creatine is a naturally-occurring compound found in the body that assists in energy production during high-intensity exercise. Supplemental creatine is often used by athletes and bodybuilders to increase muscle strength, size, and power output. It works by enhancing the body's ability to produce ATP, the primary energy source for muscle cells.  Anabolic steroids, on the other hand, are synthetic testosterone derivatives that are used to increase muscle mass and strength. They work by mimicking the effects of testosterone in the body and can produce rapid gains in muscle size and strength. However, they also carry a number of potential side effects, including acne, mood swings, aggression, and long-term health risks such as liver and heart damage.  Overall, creatine is considered a safe and effective supplement for enhancing athletic performance, while anabolic steroids are generally considered much more risky and potentially harmful.
